      "abstract": "\n For this exploratory study, we investigated the perceptions of professionals who attended Family Employment Awareness Training (FEAT), a family-focused program about competitive employment for people with disabilities. We used a pre-/post-survey design with matched respondents. We used repeated measures ANOVA, descriptive statistics, and basic interpretive qualitative analysis to analyze data. Results indicated that participants significantly improved their general expectations for the job prospects and abilities of people with disabilities and, while not statistically significant, increased their knowledge of employment resources. Participants became more confident that they could use their knowledge to address barriers to employment. They reported on accessing employment resources, professional barriers they experienced, and their perceptions of FEAT. Results indicated that attending FEAT can positively influence expectations for and knowledge of competitive employment. Results also indicated that professionals found attending FEAT worthwhile and that it improved professional confidence in addressing barriers.",

      "abstract": "Background Domestic violence (DV) is a neglected topic in health care, resulting in delays in the identification of DV victims and suboptimal care. Purpose The attitudes of health care professionals (HCPs) toward stigmas associated with victims of DV can affect the care offered to the latter. The HCPs' attitude toward victims of DV is therefore an important but neglected topic in health care research. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether awareness training changes HCPs' attitudes toward victims of DV, especially with regard to their stigmatization. Methodology Problem-centered interviews were conducted with 12 health professionals (six women and six men, six with and six without previous awareness training) concerning their attitudes and approaches to DV and those affected by it. Results Our data analysis indicates a significant difference in HPC attitudes toward potential DV victims depending on whether or not HCPs have undergone awareness training. Conclusion Awareness training does not only improve theoretical knowledge about DV; it also changes staff attitudes toward DV victims, especially with regard to their stigmatization. Practice Implications Our study shows that awareness training changes the HCPs' attitudes toward victims of DV. This change in attitude might reduce pressure on both the HCP and the victim, which in turn might help the victim to accept the care offered. Therefore, awareness training can help to reduce barriers to helping victims of DV.",

      "abstract": "Phishing remains one of the most common and advanced forms of cybercrime with serious consequences for individuals, organizations, and national infrastructures. This article offers a comprehensive literature review of recent research (2021\u20132024) into phishing attack vectors and the impact of security awareness training (SAT) in mitigating such threats. Grounded in empirical studies, simulation-based experiments, personality-based vulnerability analysis, and AI-driven detection models, the research synthesizes evidence from 30+ peer-reviewed articles to assess the effectiveness, limitations, and best practices of awareness interventions. Key findings indicate that simulation-based SAT significantly reduces user susceptibility, particularly when training is adaptive, behavior-aware, and reinforced over time. Studies confirm that demographic variables such as age and gender, as well as personality traits like neuroticism and agreeableness, influence phishing vulnerability and training success. The most prominent topics analyzed include the lifecycle and anatomy of phishing attacks, psychological and behavioral drivers of risk, demographic influences, and the integration of technical and policy-based countermeasures. The research highlights gaps in training design, fatigue-related limitations, and the need for context-sensitive delivery. It concludes by proposing a multi-dimensional solution involving personalized simulation, leadership-driven security culture, and integration with emerging technologies. This paper offers practical insights for cybersecurity practitioners, educators, and policy-makers working to reinforce the human firewall.",

      "abstract": "Aims: The study aim was to determine whether brief online suicide awareness training could increase rail workers': (1) knowledge about how to intervene safely with someone at risk on the rail; (2) belief that the rail industry could help to reduce suicides on the rail; (3) confidence to intervene with someone at risk on the rail; and (4) likelihood that they would intervene with someone at risk on the rail. Method: 1,050 rail workers completed the training and pre-/postsurveys designed to assess the impact of the training. We calculated the proportional mean change between the pre- and postintervention periods for each outcome. Results: Significant increases were observed across all outcomes. For rail workers' knowledge of how to intervene safely the proportional mean difference was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.14 to 1.16), for belief that rail workers can help to reduce rail suicides it was 1.14 (95% CI: 1.13 to 1.16), for confidence to intervene with someone at risk on the rail it was 1.24 (95% CI: 1.22 to 1.27), and for likelihood of intervention with someone at risk on the rail it was 1.03 (95% CI: 1.02 to 1.05). Limitations: This study relied on a pre-/postdesign without a control group, limiting causal inferences. Conclusion: Brief online suicide prevention awareness training appears to be effective in improving outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Phishing remains one of the most common cyber threats today, with email being the primary attack vector. Cybersecurity awareness training plays a critical role in strengthening an organization's defence against persistent threats. This research paper examines the impact of cybersecurity awareness training on employees\u2019 \u201conline\u201d behavior. The analysis utilizes results from earlier research to evaluate baseline cyber hygiene and assess how training impacts employees\u2019 ability to recognize and respond to phishing threats. Following the results, a comprehensive cybersecurity awareness training program was implemented, focusing on recognizing and reporting phishing emails, safe browsing practices, and maintaining strong passwords. The results indicate a significant improvement in the organization's cyber hygiene post-training. The data reveals a substantial decrease in the number of employees\u2019 falling victim to phishing attempts, alongside a notable increase in the reporting of phishing emails to the IT department. These findings suggest that the training not only enhanced employees' ability to recognize phishing attempts but also encouraged them to stay alert and report suspicious activities. Furthermore, this study underscores the importance of continuous training and periodic phishing simulations to sustain high levels of cybersecurity awareness. Regular training programs equip employees with the necessary skills to identify and respond to cyber threats, ultimately creating a more secure and resilient digital environment.",

      "abstract": "Phishing remains a major cybersecurity threat, exploiting human vulnerabilities through deceptive tactics. Traditional awareness training often involves simulated phishing campaigns via e-mail and similar channels, in addition to training materials for employees to complete. Prior work indicates limitations in effectiveness, highlighting the lack of interactivity and contextual factors. This paper explores an interactive, user-adaptive, LLM-based approach to phishing awareness training, combining simulated phishing campaigns with adaptive feedback mechanisms from interactive learning. A training environment was developed as a research prototype, supporting experiments on adaptive training methods, including modes of interaction, target customization, feedback, and adaptivity to user environments. The prototype demonstrates the potential of realizing these aspects with LLMs according to interactive learning principles, such as targeted user engagement and instantaneous feedback. It is intended to serve as a basis for studies on effectiveness, efficiency, and adaptive methods in corporate settings, education, or phishing prevention initiatives.",

      "abstract": "Phonological awareness, also referred to as phonemic awareness, means that children are able to identify and manipulate the sound structure of words, which is the most reliable factor predicting the effectiveness of young childrens early reading learning. Because it is important to teach literacy, Chinese character recognition, and form consciousness during the primary school lower grades, the article summarizes the impact of phonological awareness teaching on students reading, and attempts to discover this through a literature overview and a comprehensive case study. According to the literature review part, the relationship between phonological awareness and acquisition of reading ability has been confirmed to be close; among them, training phoneme skills like separation and synthesis is especially helpful for the decoding ability and reading smoothness of students. It can be seen through the cases that students had experienced remarkable improvements after the intervention of phonological awareness training in decoding skills or reading fluency. This paper argues that the earliest stage of teaching children to read and write is Phonological awareness. The author proposes suggestions based on this article that teachers may give systematic phonological awareness training and teaching activities for students in normal lessons to help children learn to read better. This research can be extended to subject field in future investigations of phonological awareness interventions on the reading abilities of children.",

      "abstract": "Human beings are often considered the weakest link in cybersecurity. Social engineering attacks exploit this vulnerability, posing significant threats to the digital assets of organizations. A highly effective strategy to protect users from falling into traps set by attackers is to implement comprehensive security awareness training focused on social engineering. In this context, the organization needs to find a cost-effective policy of allocating the security awareness training cost. We refer to the problem of finding such a policy as the security awareness training (SAT) problem. This paper addresses the SAT problem. First, an opinion dynamics-based security awareness evolution model is introduced. On this basis, the SAT problem is reduced to an optimal control model (the SAT model). Second, by deriving the optimality system for the SAT problem, an algorithm of solving the SAT model is proposed. Next, the feasibility of the proposed algorithm is validated through numerical experiments. Additionally, further exploration of the SAT algorithm are conducted. Finally, for greater versatility, the problem is formulated as a discrete-time problem (the discrete SAT problem), and the discrete SAT algorithm is proposed to solve it. This work takes the first step toward the prevention of social engineering attack through optimal control approach.",

      "abstract": "Priests are uniquely positioned as both spiritual leaders and frontline caregivers for their communities, often addressing parishioners\u2019 emotional and psychological struggles. However, most lack formal training to handle mental health issues\u2014either their own or those of their congregants. This paper argues for the essential inclusion of mental health awareness training in priestly formation and continuing education. By exploring the challenges priests face, the mental health needs of parishioners, and strategies for implementing training, this paper proposes an integrative approach to holistic ministry that bridges theology and psychology, affirming that mental health care is not separate from spiritual well-being but rather an essential aspect of pastoral responsibility. This theological framework underscores that the care of the mind is as important as the care of the soul, aligning with the Church\u2019s mission of holistic healing and pastoral care.",

      "abstract": "We provided predator awareness training to a group of captive-raised western ringtail possums (Pseudocheirus occidentalis), a critically endangered arboreal marsupial, to assess their learning capacity and test if predator awareness improved survival after release into the wild. Fifteen out of 29 captively raised individuals undertook three training sessions, during which they were placed in an enclosure with a taxidermic fox (Vulpes vulpes) and fox urine, while producing loud noises to frighten the animal. In addition, in the third session, the fox was also placed on wheels to make it move. All individuals were released in Yalgorup National Park (Western Australia) and radio tracked for three months. Two individuals from the control group and two from the trained group were excluded from the analyses, therefore the resulting sample consisted of 25 possums. Fox awareness training improved survival rate: 10 of 13 trained and 3 of 12 untrained possums were still alive three months after release (\u03c72\u2009=\u20096.740, N\u2009=\u200925, df\u2009=\u20091, p\u2009=\u20090.009). Fox predation was confirmed in two animals, both of which had not received the training. Our results show that possums can learn and be taught to fear foxes to improve the success of their translocations.",

To achieve this, a survey and Delphi analysis were conducted with researchers engaged in the operation of vehicles for individuals with disabilities and experts in the rehabilitation field to derive educational topics, components, and indicators for the development of a disability awareness training program. The analysis revealed that understanding and improving awareness of disabilities, providing services for transportation-vulnerable individuals, understanding legal and institutional frameworks, and responding to emergencies are essential components of educational programs targeted at low-floor bus drivers. Furthermore, these elements are expected to play a critical role in establishing a practical foundation for ensuring the right to mobility for individuals with disabilities. In conclusion, this study presents a basic framework and direction for developing educational programs for low-floor bus drivers. Future research should aim to expand the generalizability of practical applications by including diverse regions and groups and systematically verify the effectiveness of such educational programs.",

A total of 122 students, 62 in the control group and 60 in the intervention group, were included in the study. \u201cIntroductory Information Form\u201d and \u201cCyberbullying Awareness Scale (CAS)\u201d prepared by the researchers in line with the literature were used as data collection tools. The level of cyberbullying awareness of all students selected for the intervention and control groups was determined before the training program. The training program was given in four sessions. Three months after the training, students in both the intervention and control groups were asked to fill out the CAS.\n \n \n \n \n It was determined that the control and intervention groups had a homogeneous distribution in terms of demographic characteristics. In terms of their pre-test and post-test mean scores on the CAS, there was no statistically significant difference between the control and intervention groups (\n P\n > .05). However, within the control group, a statistically significant difference was found between the pre-training and post-training CAS scores (Z = \u22122.890;\n P\n = .004 < .05). In contrast, the intervention group showed no statistically significant difference between their pre-training and post-training CAS scores (\n P\n > .05).\n \n \n \n \n This study evaluated the effects of nurse-led training program aimed at increasing cyberbullying awareness. Comprehensive and long-term awareness programs led by nurses are likely to produce more lasting and effective outcomes for young individuals.\n",

      "abstract": "Occupational safety training is critical to ensuring a safe work environment. However, traditional training methods often fail to fully engage learners and replicate real-world scenarios. The emergence of metaverse technologies presents new opportunities to digitally transform occupational safety awareness training. In this study, a novel approach is proposed for occupational safety awareness training using immersive simulations within the metaverse. The approach was evaluated by analyzing the acceptance, effectiveness, and interaction with usability success rate and administered a user experience questionnaire (UEQ). The research results indicate that incorporating immersive technology enhances the quality of training experience. The proposed model achieved an average usability success rate of 71%, reflecting an overwhelmingly positive user experience. The UEQ scores confirm this positive trend, with users rating attractiveness and stimulation as good (respectively 1.78 and 1.70). At the same time, perspicuity, efficiency, reliability, and novelty received ratings surpassing the average (ranging from 1.22 to 1.51). The efficacy of an immersive approach for occupational safety training was 65.8%, which qualifies as sufficiently effective. These findings highlight the potential of immersive technology in advancing occupational safety training by enhancing engagement, comprehension, technology performance, and empowering learners in safety awareness journey.",

      "abstract": "Human errors remain one of the leading causes of cybersecurity breaches during the rapid growth of cyber-attack techniques recently, underscoring the need for adaptive and personalized training programs. Traditional Cybersecurity Awareness Training (CSAT) programs often rely on static content, lack of personalization, and struggle remain in the face of evolving threats. This study presents an AI driven CSAT framework that integrates Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), Online Machine Learning, and adaptive data processing to deliver personalized, scalable, and real-time training contents. The proposed model utilizes GAI to dynamically generate interactive training contents tailored to individual user profiles based on job roles, behavioural risk indicators, impact assessment scores, and the pre-assessment outcomes. An online Na\u00efve Bayes algorithm enables continuous risk profiling and content adaptation according to user performance, while windowing technique and integrated search engine ensure up-to-date and contextually relevant training materials. The proposed system aligns with Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy and MITRE ATT&CK framework to ensure cognitive depth and real-world attack vector relevance. The research demonstrates that the integration of GAI with adaptive learning technologies significantly improves knowledge retention, enhance user engagement, and delivers cost-effective training solution. Further this study highlights the potential of GAI in revolutionizing cybersecurity training, ensuring resilience against evolving cyber-threats.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Loss of situational awareness (SA) accounts for 82% of incidents due to human error in anesthesia. Despite its importance, SA training has traditionally been informal and inconsistent. Integrating SA into residency training is essential to enhance resident performance.\nObjective: This pilot study aimed to identify SA training needs for anesthesia residents.\nMethods: A three-level training needs analysis was conducted: 1. Organizational level: focus groups with faculty members were held to identify critical competencies. 2. Task level: five surgical procedures were observed using eye-tracking glasses to detect observable undesired events (OUEs). 3. Personal level: Interviews with residents and faculty were conducted to analyze the causes of OUEs and learning gaps.\nResults: A total of 17 training needs were identified. First-year residents require skill development in perception and comprehension, second-year residents need to improve attentional skills, and third-year residents should focus on projection skills.\nConclusions: This qualitative observational study enabled the identification of gaps in SA training among anesthesiology residents. A total of 17 specific training needs were identified, which can be implemented in SA training programs for anesthesiology across various institutions. To ensure continuous evaluation and adaptation, it is recommended that these programs be progressively developed through high-fidelity clinical simulations, utilizing tools such as eye-tracking glasses.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objectives This study examined if and how first responders in Nigeria provide Psychological First Aid to emergency victims. Key objectives include assessing first responders\u2019 awareness of Psychological First Aid, determining their level of PFA training and level of PFA utilization with emergency treatment. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional survey that adopted a mixed-method approach was utilized. This study was carried out among first responders living in Lagos State, Nigeria. The quantitative aspect of the study consisted of 386 respondents. In contrast, for the qualitative study, 17 participants were selected using snowball sampling across various strata of first responders based on their diverse roles and experience in emergency response. Results Findings from this study deduced that 59.6% of respondents were aware of, 27.2% were trained, and 38.3% practiced PFA. However, findings noted a significant difference in awareness based on education, as persons with tertiary education were 4.21 times more likely to be aware than those without (OR = 1.73-10.23). Qualitative findings revealed that respondents lacked access to opportunities to practice PFA due to the absence of protocols in their learning and practice environments. Conclusions This study highlights varying levels of awareness and training in Psychological First Aid (PFA) among respondents, indicating both opportunities and challenges in preparedness for emergency response. Strategies that promote PFA awareness among older age groups should be developed, and entry-level first responders should also receive PFA training.",

This study evaluates the effectiveness of a hands-on approach based on interactive scenarios using FLECO Studio software, integrated into the holistic management model CyberTOMP, compared to a traditional lecture-based approach framed within the same model. An experiment was designed with 200 participants, divided into a treatment group (70%) and a control group (30%). Both groups received training aimed at increasing their level of situational awareness in cybersecurity, with assessments conducted before and after the training. The treatment group employed the interactive scenario-based approach modeled with FLECO Studio, while the control group received traditional lecture-based training. To mitigate potential biases, preventive measures were implemented during the design and analysis of the study. The statistically analyzed results illustrated a significant improvement (up to 54%) in the situational awareness level of the treatment group, along with a strongly positive perception of effectiveness among the participants. These findings suggest that the interactive scenario-based approach, using tools embedded within a comprehensive holistic framework, significantly enhances the acquisition of situational awareness capabilities in cybersecurity compared to a traditional lecture-based approach.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background The burden of diabetes and obesity are greater for some racial-ethnic minority groups in the United States, including non-Hispanic blacks, underscoring the importance of raising community awareness of diabetes prevention. Community health workers (CHWs) play a critical role in extending our reach into communities to raise awareness of diabetes prevention. Systematic training and support are central to their work. Remote approaches have been helpful in delivering training to overcome common participation barriers. One remote approach, immersive 3D virtual worlds (VW) offer a unique approach to providing remote training incorporating engaging interactive contextual learning opportunities. Objective This study aimed to implement and evaluate an internet-based 3D VW model to remotely deliver an adapted CHW training program on diabetes prevention awareness for racial-ethnic minority communities. Methods A sequential mixed methods design, including a pre-post pilot and explanatory phase, examined the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of the VW training. Female CHWs who self-identified as African American or Black or African Ancestry, between 21\u201065 years of age, fluent in English, and with risk factors for diabetes were recruited. CHW input was gathered to adapt a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s CHW diabetes prevention awareness training and the VW environment for this study. The final adapted training was standardized for delivery over 10 weeks. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected to examine acceptability, feasibility, and impact of the training model. Primary quantitative pre-post outcomes included training content knowledge and confidence; and secondary behavioral outcomes included motivation for lifestyle change and eating habits. Focus group feedback was collected on acceptability and feasibility during the explanatory phase. Quantitative descriptive and qualitative thematic analysis approaches were used to examine the acceptability, feasibility, and impact of the VW training model. Results A total of 26 CHWs initiated the study and 22 completed the postassessment. The majority of participants reported that their expectations were met across all sessions and content topics. Participants generally reported satisfaction with the information provided (20/22, 91% rated very good-excellent) and high levels of interactivity in the training (17/22, 77% rated very good-excellent). Results of the posttraining acceptability and feasibility quantitative survey and qualitative feedback were generally positive. Mean pre-post values improved across all quantitative outcomes for the VW training group (eg, 92% [11/12] improved in knowledge; 62% [8/13]\u201077% [10/13] improved across eating habits measures). Explanatory focus group findings were generally positive, highlighting satisfaction with the overall training, its interactivity, and content. The main constructive feedback was related to providing more training and support in using the avatar. Conclusions Findings on the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary impact of the VW training model are promising and support continued use, development, and research on this approach.",

      "abstract": "Summary This study investigates the effects of instruction in mor - phology in both oral and written modality on morpholo - gical skills and both spelling and reading of a group of Portuguese speaking children in Grade 3. We conducted morphological training across 19 sessions with 17 students and compared its effects to a \u2018business as usual\u2019 control group of 16 students. The groups were matched based on performance on measures of verbal and non-verbal abilities as well as phonological awareness. Pre-and post-tests included morphological awareness, spelling of morphologically complex words and other word types, as well as word-level reading. Analyses revealed significant effects of the intervention on morphological awareness and spelling of morphologically complex words, but not on word-level reading or spelling. These findings point to relatively specific effects of morphological training, albeit ones that are likely to be quite helpful to children given the prevalence of morphologically complex words in written texts.",

      "abstract": "Suicide is a leading cause of death among construction workers, particularly younger and lower-skilled employees. Barriers such as stigma, low mental health literacy, and traditional masculine norms hinder help-seeking in this male-dominated sector. Few mental health interventions are tailored to this context. This study developed a co-designed, theory-informed training to improve mental health literacy, reduce stigma, and increase help-seeking among construction workers in Ireland. Using the Medical Research Council\u2019s framework, the training was developed with the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Behavior Change Techniques, and extensive stakeholder co-design. Two systematic reviews, a broad literature review, and focus groups with industry managers informed the content and structure. The training will be pilot-tested using validated measures: the Literacy of Suicide Scale (LOSS), the Stigma of Suicide Scale (SOSS), and the General Help-Seeking Questionnaire (GHSQ), the results of which will be the subject of a separate study. CAIRDE is a promising, evidence-based training that addresses key mental health barriers in Irish construction. Embedding the TPB within a co-design methodology has resulted in the development of a training program that is underpinned by theoretical fidelity and cultural relevance and provides a framework for other male-dominated industries to draw upon. Future work should address remaining challenges related to stigma and help-seeking, and explore broader implementation through integration into mandatory safety training.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents an innovative procedure for the stability assessment of masonry domes, aiming at simplifying the modelling and the computational stages of structural analysis. It exploits a macroscopic approach to discretise masonry, specifically using elastic bodies linked by nonlinear interfaces. The latter are made by axial and, when needed, tangential trusses\u2014in turn characterised by an elastic perfectly plastic/brittle behaviour\u2014which constitute the joints connecting homogenised elastic macroblocks. The objective is\u2014by employing low-cost commercial Finite Element software\u2014to predict the behaviour of a masonry curved structure up to failure, maintaining the computational complexity low and the approach accessible to a common user. The process enables not only the quantification of damage at failure but also the tracking of its evolution within the structure, by examining axial forces found in the trusses at each load step. The method allows the modelling of the response of any kind of masonry structure under imposed loads or displacements. Its efficacy is proven on a paradigmatic dome (Global Vipassana Pagoda, Mumbai, India) by comparing the results with limit analysis precedent studies. Finally, the major reliability of a 3D approach is demonstrated.",

Goenka learned Vipassan\u0101 from Sayagyi U Ba Khin of Myanmar and introduced the technique from Mynmar to India, Nepal and many other countries. Largely based on a descriptive framework and mixed methods, the study evaluates the effects of Vipassan\u0101 practice on personal and professional lives of lay meditators. In addition to secondary data, primary data were collected through structured questionnaire from 215 old Vipassan\u0101 students who had participated in at least one Vipassan\u0101 course as taught by S. N. Goenka and continued their practice. Empirical analysis demonstrated that Vipassan\u0101 practice brings positive impacts on personal and professional life of lay meditators. On a personal level, by purifying meditators\u2019 minds, Vipassan\u0101 practice helps them develop a positive and optimistic attitude, reduce anger, stress and anxiety, improve personal and social relation, and enhance the quality of self-realization. These personal attributes further contribute to professional development as well. By improving concentration, Vipassan\u0101 practice can transform individuals from within, ultimately benefiting their professional lives. Gradually, a Vipassan\u0101 meditator can improve relationships with colleagues and subordinates, motivate others at work, enhance planning and decision-making abilities, and demonstrate improved efficiency and productivity in their organization. Regardless of gender, age, marital status, profession, educational background, the study found significant positive effects of Vipassan\u0101 practice on the personal and professional life of lay meditators. In most clusters, frequency analysis data were supported by chi-square test results at a five percent level of significance.",

      "abstract": "Vipassana meditation, an ancient Buddhist-derived practice that emphasises insight through non-judgmental observation of sensations and thoughts, has gained popularity for its potential to enhance health and well-being. Building on earlier research, this updated review synthesises empirical evidence published since 2010 to evaluate the impact of Vipassana across the psychological, physiological, neurobiological, and behavioural domains, addressing the growing need for effective, evidence-based approaches to global mental health challenges. Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, databases such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, PsycINFO, and Scopus were searched from January 2010 to April 2025 to identify relevant studies. Eligible studies comprised randomized controlled trials (RCTs), single-arm trials, pilot studies, and observational designs published in English, involving adult participants and quantifiable outcomes. Reviews, non-Vipassana practices, and low-quality studies with fewer than 10 participants per group were excluded, while the risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) 2 tool and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Given the heterogeneity, the findings were synthesised narratively, exploring subgroups based on retreat intensity and practitioner experience. Eleven studies were included (three RCTs, two single-arm trials, one pilot trial, and five observational trials), revealing psychological outcomes such as reductions in stress and anxiety alongside gains in mindfulness and well-being; physiological and neurobiological findings included improved hippocampal topology, increased heart rate variability, and fewer migraine days; and behavioural improvements encompassed enhanced executive functions and memory consolidation, with stronger effects noted in intensive retreats and among experienced meditators, although evidence was limited by small sample sizes, moderate to high risk of bias, and absence of blinding. In conclusion, moderate evidence supports the benefits of Vipassana meditation for psychological and physiological health, particularly in alleviating stress, anxiety, and migraine burden while enhancing mindfulness and neurobiological markers, with effects appearing intensity-dependent and retreats yielding sustained advantages. Despite methodological limitations, Vipassana holds promise as an adjunct for stress-related disorders, warranting larger, well-controlled RCTs to substantiate its long-term efficacy.",

This article delves into the adaptability and practical value of Luangpor Pramote Pamojjo's comprehensive meditation in contemporary society. The article first discusses the background and formation of his meditation system. Then it discusses how he characterizes the two temperaments of practitioners in the field of vipassana meditation considering the human condition in an age of digital communication and the intensification of consumerism. This involves the way contemporary people are either distracted or experience an intensification of \"craving\" (greed). By placing the meditation method of Luangpor Pramote in this contemporary context, this paper demonstrates the appeal of its doctrine to the characteristics of contemporary meditators.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT\nVipassana meditation (VM), a mindfulness-based practice, has been known to promote good health all the way. Global chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and hypertension often bring physical and mental pain together. Through developing emotional regulation and helping to reduce stress, VM can be used as an alternative medicine in combination with the conventional therapies now used for treating this condition.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe aim of the study was to evaluate how VM alters key health measures, including body weight, blood pressure and sugar levels, pulse rate, body mass index (BMI), and emotional state. It also sought to identify changes in emotional spectrum of reactions, such as fear, expectations, and concern before/after the 10-day VM camp.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA pre-experimental study was done at Khadavli Vipassana Center, from which time it admitted 156 first-time participants. After excluding four participants, the final sample size was 152. Health indices were assessed before and after the meditation using standard tools, while the emotional spectrum was ascertained with a unstructured questionnaire. Paired samples t-tests and analysis of the content of emotional responses were conducted on the data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were significant improvements in physical health: the participants' mean weight decreased by 0.8 kg, BMI dropped 0.3 kg/m\u00b2, and their systolic and diastolic readings were slightly reduced. This was accompanied with reduced random blood sugar (by 8.8 mg/dl). Oxygen saturation (SpO2) increased by 0.92%. Emotional responses demonstrated a marked reduction in fear and a corresponding increase in positive affect, including enhanced feelings of peace and well-being, observed upon completion of the 10-day intervention period. People said that they had found peace of mind and taken away stress.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nVM has a significant impact on the physical health system and psychological health, which suggests that it may be not only useful in relieving chronic illness but also could become an adjunct to standard medical treatment. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Vipassana meditation (VM) is an ancient meditation technique based on the teachings of\u2002Gautama Buddha that involves becoming aware of the present moment and the associated experiences. Therapeutic psychology practices such as mindfulness show promise for improving mental health in terms of stress reduction, emotional regulation, and overall well-being. Despite\u2002the increasing use of mindfulness-based interventions, relatively little is known about the unique contribution of VM to the development of mindfulness. Objectives The objective of this study was to measure the effect of VM on two key components of mindfulness, awareness and acceptance, using the Philadelphia Mindfulness Scale (PHLMS). Materials and methods A pre-experimental (pre-test and post-test design) study was conducted at Khadavali Vipassana Centre in Thane, India, over a period of 18 months. The sample (N=156) included participants from diverse\u2002socio-demographic backgrounds who engaged in VM for 10 days. The participants were assessed using the PHLMS, a self-report instrument for measuring mindfulness\u2002as present-centered awareness and non-judgmental acceptance. Both descriptive and inferential statistics and Wilcoxon\u2019s signed-rank test were used to analyze the pre- and post-test mindfulness scores. Results A significant increase in mindfulness was observed post-intervention across all participant groups. Specifically, the average\u2002total score for mindfulness increased from 61.47 to 81.09 (p < 0.001). Both the awareness subscale and the acceptance subscale increased significantly from the pre-intervention stage to the post-intervention stage, awareness from 30.76 to 41.11 and acceptance\u2002from 30.70 to 39.99. A significant proportion of the participants progressed from a lower level of mindfulness to a higher level, with 74.3% achieving\u2002a high level of mindfulness after the VM retreat. Conclusion VM appears to promote mindfulness, mainly because of the effect of\u2002acceptance. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating the value of VM as an intervention in therapeutic work for enhancing mindfulness and, thereby, mental health.",

      "abstract": "Vipassana, an ancient meditation technique taught by Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha), has been practiced for over 2,500 years as a path to wisdom and liberation. In the context of modern life, which is filled with stress and distractions, the application of Vipassana as a tool for enhancing mental and physical well-being has gained increasing attention1. This study explores Vipassana\u2019s profound impact on inner transformation, emotional regulation, and the relationship between meditation practice and personal and social well-being. The paper is based on an analysis of the principles of the Dharma and Vipassana within the framework of modern philosophy and psychology, combined with empirical evaluations from previous studies on the effects of meditation on mental health and personality development.\n Vipassana reduces stress and improves self-awareness, emotional regulation, and inner balance. This practice helps eliminate negative thought patterns, fostering a clear, tranquil mind. Additionally, Vipassana contributes to the development of compassion and enhances the quality of interpersonal relationships. This study highlights the role of Vipassana as a practical method for addressing the challenges of modern life. By promoting mindfulness and inner harmony, Vipassana provides personal benefits and builds a more understanding and connected society.\n Vipassana meditation presents a plethora of pragmatic advantages, ranging from the alleviation of stress and anxiety to the enhancement of mental and physical health. Through the focal practice of breath awareness and the non-judgmental observation of bodily sensations, Vipassana practitioners can eradicate detrimental thoughts and cultivate a lucid, tranquil mind. This approach augments self-awareness and emotional regulation and establishes an inner equilibrium, fostering joy and harmony within the quotidian experience.",

      "abstract": "Human desires and worldly pursuits are sources of suffering for individuals and society. The Buddha, time and again, taught that our freedom lies in our hands, more specifically in the boundaries of our minds. The heart of Buddhist practice to achieve freedom is a life of ethical conduct (s\u00eela) and the practice of concentration (sam\u00e2dhi) and wisdom (pa\u00f1\u00f1\u00e2). The two meditation techniques to achieve concentration and wisdom are samatha and vipassan\u00e2 meditation. Although in Western culture, they are often separated by the popular focus on mindfulness or concentration meditation mainly, these two meditation techniques are not two separate methods. In Buddhist training for freedom, they form two interrelated parts of a whole, both crucial to attaining complete liberation. They are the methodical effort to tame and master the mind and to develop its capacity for calm and insight. Vipassan\u00e2 is a path to wisdom, spiritual liberation, and the pursuit of freedom from the bondage of mental impurities, suffering, and repeated rebirth. Having achieved the foundational ground of concentration with samatha meditation, one can eradicate the deepest level of mental impurities with vipassan\u00e2 meditation.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: The detrimental effects of anger on psychological and physical health have been highlighted by traditional and contemporary perspectives. Conversely, forgiveness is increasingly recognised as a protective factor that contributes to emotional regulation and good health. In recent years, mind-body practices, such as yoga and Vipassana meditation, have gained empirical support for their therapeutic potential, particularly in managing stress-related conditions.\n\nAim: To examine the effectiveness of Vipassana meditation and yoga in enhancing forgiveness and reducing anger among individuals diagnosed with Coronary Heart Disease (CHD).\n\nMaterials and Methods: The prospective interventional study design was used in the present research. The purposive sampling technique was used to collect data from Agra, Gwalior and Firozabad cities of India. Subjects were contacted through personal and social connections as this study required sixmonths commitment. Nearly 230 subjects were contacted and 74 gave consent to participate. In the final stage, a total of 60 patients with CHD, aged 40-60 years, participated in the study. Based on their willingness to engage in regular practice, participants were assigned to one of three groups: Group I, Vipassana meditation (n=20); Group II, yoga (n=20); and Group III, control (n=20). The experimental groups engaged in their respective interventions for six months, while the control group received no such intervention. The anger scale (2017) and the forgiveness scale (2021) were used to collect data from participants.\n\nResults: The findings indicated significant improvement in forgiveness (p=0.01) and reductions in anger (p=0.01) among participants in both intervention groups. Specifically, Vipassana meditation demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing revenge-related tendencies (p=0.01) and enhancing both self (p=0.01) and other-forgiveness (p=0.01). Yoga was found to have a broader impact, significantly improving the emotional, cognitive, and trait dimensions of forgiveness. No significant changes were observed in the control group.\n\nConclusion: The study concluded that regular engagement in yoga or Vipassana meditation is significantly helpful in promoting forgiveness and in reducing anger in patients with CHD. These practices show potential as accessible, non-pharmacological approaches for enhancing emotional well-being and may also contribute to cardiovascular health.",

      "abstract": "Purpose Meditation has been demonstrated to benefit adolescent mental health. This research examined various meditation styles practiced in northern Thailand to determine which were associated with positive and negative mental health outcomes in adolescents. Population and methods High school students who were 15\u201318 years old and who were enrolled in grades 10\u201312 in either secular or Buddhist Thai boarding schools were recruited following their school\u2019s willingness to participate. They provided information about meditation styles and their practice frequency during the last month (i.e., breathing, kasina (color), Buddha image visualization, Manomayiddhi, mindfulness, recollections, and vipassan\u0101). The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), Resilience Inventory (RI-9), Outcome Inventory-21 (OI-21), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) were completed. Multiple linear regression model analysis was used to identify the effects of meditation styles on mental health outcomes. Results Among 443 participants, 390 were females (87.9%). The mean age was 16.35\u2009\u00b1\u20090.96 years. The three most common meditation styles practiced were breathing, Buddha image visualization, and mindfulness (46.5%, 26.2%, and 22.8%, respectively). Buddha image visualization was a significant predictor of RSES (B\u2009=\u20091.69, 95%CI\u2009=\u20090.77, 2.61), RI-9 (B\u2009=\u20092.95, 95%CI\u2009=\u20090.68, 2.95), OI-Anxiety (B\u2009=\u2009\u22122.38, 95%CI\u2009=\u2009\u22123.34, \u22121.41), OI-Depression (B\u2009=\u2009\u22121.94, 95%CI\u2009=\u2009\u22122.64, \u22121.24), and PSS-10 (B\u2009=\u2009\u22122.47, 95%CI\u2009=\u2009\u22123.65, \u22121.28), whereas Manomayiddhi was a predictor of RI-9 (B\u2009=\u20092.47, 95%CI\u2009=\u20090.74, 2.47), OI-Anxiety (B\u2009=\u2009\u22122.32, 95%CI\u2009=\u2009\u22123.41, \u22121.23), OI-Depression (B\u2009=\u2009\u22121.53, 95%CI\u2009=\u2009\u22122.32, \u22120.74), and PSS-10 (B\u2009=\u2009\u22122.14, 95%CI\u2009=\u2009\u22123.46, \u22120.81). Breathing meditation predicted OI-Depression (B\u2009=\u2009\u22120.87, 95%CI\u2009=\u2009\u22121.45, \u22120.29). Daily meditation frequency was associated with the best mental health scores (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Conclusion Buddha image visualization, Manomayiddhi, and breathing meditation were predictive of adolescents\u2019 mental health. A higher practice frequency is associated with positive mental health outcomes.",

      "abstract": "The Thoughtseeds Framework introduces a novel computational approach to modeling thought dynamics in meditative states, conceptualizing thoughtseeds as dynamic attentional agents that integrate information. This hierarchical model, structured as nested Markov blankets, comprises three interconnected levels: (i) knowledge domains as information repositories, (ii) the Thoughtseed Network where thoughtseeds compete, and (iii) meta-cognition regulating awareness. It simulates focused-attention Vipassana meditation via rule-based training informed by empirical neuroscience research on attentional stability and neural dynamics. Four states\u2014breath_control, mind_wandering, meta_awareness, and redirect_breath\u2014emerge organically from thoughtseed interactions, demonstrating self-organizing dynamics. Results indicate that experts sustain control dominance to reinforce focused attention, while novices exhibit frequent, prolonged mind_wandering episodes, reflecting beginner instability. Integrating Global Workspace Theory and the Intrinsic Ignition Framework, the model elucidates how thoughtseeds shape a unitary meditative experience through meta-awareness, balancing epistemic and pragmatic affordances via active inference. Synthesizing computational modeling with phenomenological insights, it provides an embodied perspective on cognitive state emergence and transitions, offering testable predictions about meditation skill development. The framework yields insights into attention regulation, meta-cognitive awareness, and meditation state emergence, establishing a versatile foundation for future research into diverse meditation practices (e.g., Open Monitoring, Non-Dual Awareness), cognitive development across the lifespan, and clinical applications in mindfulness-based interventions for attention disorders, advancing our understanding of the nature of mind and thought.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores the integration of eastern philosophical practices, particularly Self-Enquiry, into contemporary psychotherapy. It begins by examining various philosophical traditions\u2019 views on the self, contrasting eastern and western perspectives. Self-Enquiry, rooted in Indian Vedantic philosophy, offers a unique pathway to psychological well-being by encouraging individuals to question the nature of the self and transcend egoic identification. The practical application of Self-Enquiry in psychotherapy is discussed alongside similar introspective practices such as Isha Kriya, Vipassana, and Zen meditation. These methods foster cognitive realignment and emotional regulation by addressing cognitive distortions at their root. The paper proposes a preliminary methodological framework that incorporates Self-Enquiry into therapeutic practices, highlighting its potential to support clients\u2019 mental health and spiritual growth. The challenges of cultural adaptation, ethical considerations, and therapist competency are examined, emphasizing the importance of specialized guidance in applying these practices. Ultimately, this integration offers an innovative approach to mental health by promoting philosophical health and holistic well-being.",

In just a few decades, a largely unknown Buddhist meditation practice has become a method used by psychotherapists, hospitals, and even the U.S. military.

In this modernized form, mindfulness practice became medicalized and a useful mental tool in an industrial information society. Today, mindfulness practice is a tool for self-optimization, but also a method of healing and strengthening. Both the practice and the theoretical understanding of the practice have changed: it is not about nirvana, but about self-regulation, self-control, and efficiency.",

      "abstract": "The resurgence of Ther\u0101v\u0101da Buddhism in Nepal during the 20th century, following a period of marginalization under the Hindu monarchy, was largely driven by a few pioneering monks, lay practitioners, and scholars. These trailblazers played a critical role in reviving Buddhist practices and philosophies in Nepal, which had once been at the core of the country\u2019s spiritual and cultural identity. This article explores the contributions of key figures whose efforts were instrumental in the establishment of Ther\u0101v\u0101da Buddhism as a major religious force in modern Nepal. By focusing on their life stories, their academic and social contributions, and the contexts in which they worked, this study highlights their influence on the revitalization of Ther\u0101v\u0101da Buddhism, the transformation of Nepali society, and the development of Buddhist institutions. These figures not only revived meditation practices such as Vipassan\u0101 but also emphasized the relevance of Buddhist ethics in addressing social issues, particularly caste discrimination and gender inequality. Their work laid the foundation for Buddhist education in Nepal, with the creation of meditation centers, educational institutions, and social justice initiatives. This article underscores the enduring impact of these trailblazers on the spiritual, social, and cultural fabric of Nepal, offering a nuanced perspective on the role of Ther\u0101v\u0101da Buddhism in shaping the modern Nepali identity.",

      "abstract": "\n \n Chronic pain significantly impacts quality of life. Mind\u2013body interventions (MBIs), such as yoga nidra and body scan, show promise in managing pain. Yoga nidra incorporates intention-setting, visualization, and relaxation, whereas body scan focuses on somatic awareness. While prior literature has applied meditation as a therapeutic intervention in individuals with chronic pain, limited literature has compared the effects of yoga nidra and body scan on pain outcomes.\n \n \n \n The aim of the study was to compare the immediate effects of yoga nidra and body scan on pain intensity, pain anxiety, well-being, and optimism in adults with chronic pain.\n \n \n \n \n A quasi-experimental study with 23 participants experiencing chronic pain was conducted. Participants underwent either a 45-min yoga nidra (\n n\n = 12) or body scan session (\n n\n = 11). Outcomes were assessed pre-, post-, and 24-h post intervention.\n \n \n \n \n \n Both interventions significantly reduced pain intensity and pain-related anxiety over time (\n P\n < 0.01), with reductions observed regardless of group. Yoga nidra demonstrated greater improvements in well-being immediately post intervention compared to body scan (\n P\n = 0.01). No significant differences or main effects were found between groups for optimism (\n P\n = 0.60).\n \n \n \n \n Both yoga nidra and body scans reduce pain intensity and pain-related anxiety. Yoga nidra uniquely enhances well-being, supporting its use as a therapeutic MBI for chronic pain.\n",

      "abstract": "Given the increasing interest in the potential cognitive benefits of green tea, this study evaluated the efficacy of processed green tea products as nootropic agents. We conducted a 12-week, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to assess the effects of heat-treated green tea extract (HT-GTE) supplementation on memory performance in individuals with subjective memory impairment (SMI). A total of 80 participants with SMI (mean age 49.6\u2009\u00b1\u20095.6 years) were randomly assigned to either the HT-GTE group (n = 40) or the placebo group (n = 40). Memory performance was assessed using standardized composite scores at baseline and week 12. Additionally, we examined changes in functional connectivity (FC) within the default mode network (DMN), a key resting-state network associated with memory function, at both time points. Compared to the placebo group, the HT-GTE group demonstrated significant improvements in memory function after 12 weeks, as evidenced by a greater increase in composite scores (z = 2.535, P for interaction = .011). Furthermore, the HT-GTE group exhibited increased FC within the right precuneus region of the DMN (z = 2.554, P for interaction = .011). These findings underscore the potential of HT-GTE supplementation to enhance memory performance and FC within the DMN in middle-aged individuals with SMI, offering valuable insights into the cognitive benefits of green tea.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Although a number of neuroimaging studies on problematic internet use (PIU) have been conducted, few studies on non-problematic internet use (non-PIU) are available; therefore, the influences of non-PIU on brain function are unclear. Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) could be an appropriate tool to investigate subclinical samples, such as non-PIU, to capture the potentially subtle changes compared to clinical samples. In the context of rsFC, the default mode network (DMN), the central executive network (CEN), and the salience network (SN) are representative of the brain networks. Because accumulating studies have investigated rsFC between these networks in PIU samples, investigating rsFC between these networks in non-PIU samples could give us a clue to elucidate the neural basis of non-PIU in relation to those of PIU. Methods We recruited 119 healthy volunteers and used the General Problematic Internet Use Scale-2 (GPIUS-2) to measure their propensity to use the Internet. The GPIUS-2 consists of four subscales. We analyzed the correlation between the degree of Internet use assessed by the GPIUS-2 and the rsFC of the regions comprising DMN, CEN, and SN using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in non-PIU samples. Results There was a positive correlation between the mood regulation subscale score and SN (bilateral anterior insula) \u2013 CEN (left lateral prefrontal cortex: LPFC), SN (left anterior insula) \u2013 DMN (medial prefrontal cortex: MPFC), and DMN (MPFC) \u2013 CEN (right LPFC) rsFC. Additionally, there was a negative correlation between the mood regulation subscale score and DMN \u2013 FPN rsFC. Discussion The correlations between rsFC and non-PIU suggest that non-PIU and PIU could influence rsFC in opposite directions. Furthermore, the hub regions comprising connections correlated with non-PIU in this study are involved in cognitive and emotional processes. One possible interpretation would be that the bilateral insula and synchronized LPFC activity in individuals with non-PIU results in well-functioning emotion regulation as an appropriate coping strategy, in contrast to PIU. These findings suggest that non-PIU might contribute to health promotion through mood regulation with alterations in the functional connectivity between the regions involved in mood regulation.",

      "abstract": "Background Social dysfunction is an early manifestation of neuropsychiatric disorders that may relate to altered Default Mode Network (DMN) integrity. This study aimed to replicate previous findings linking social dysfunction with diminished resting-state DMN functional connectivity and altered task-based DMN functional activation in response to emotional faces across schizophrenia (SZ), Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), and healthy controls (HC), and to extend these findings to major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods Resting-state fMRI and task-based fMRI data on implicit facial emotional processing were acquired in an overlapping cohort (resting-state fMRI: N=167; SZ=32, MDD=44, AD=29, HC=62. Task-based fMRI: N=152; SZ=30, MDD=42, AD=26, HC=54). Additionally, mega-analyses (N=317 for resting-state fMRI; N=291 for task-based fMRI) of the current and a prior independent sample were conducted. Social dysfunction was indexed with the Social Functioning Scale (SFS) and the De Jong-Gierveld Loneliness (LON) scale. Results The association between higher mean SFS+LON social dysfunction scores and diminished DMN connectivity within the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex across SZ/AD/HC participants was replicated, and extended to MDD patients. Similar observations within the dorsomedial and rostromedial prefrontal cortex were found in the mega-analysis. Associations between social dysfunction and DMN activation in response to sad and happy faces were not replicated or found in the mega-analysis. Conclusions Diminished dorsomedial prefrontal cortex DMN connectivity emerged as a transdiagnostic neurobiological marker for social dysfunction, suggesting a potential treatment target for precision medicine approaches. DMN functional responses to emotional faces may not be a sensitive biomarker for social dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Mind wandering (MW) encompasses both a deliberate and a spontaneous disengagement of attention from the immediate external environment to unrelated internal thoughts. Importantly, MW has been suggested to have an inverse relationship with mindfulness, a state of nonjudgmental awareness of present-moment experience. Although they are, respectively, associated with increased and decreased activity in the default mode network (DMN), the specific contributions of deliberate and spontaneous MW, and their relationships with mindfulness abilities and resting-state macro networks remain to be elucidated. Therefore, resting-state MRI scans from 76 participants were analyzed with group independent component analysis to decompose brain networks into independent macro-networks and to see which of them predicted specific aspects of spontaneous and deliberate MW or mindfulness traits. Our results show that temporal variability of the resting-state DMN predicts spontaneous MW, which in turn is negatively associated with the acting with awareness facet of mindfulness. This finding shows that the DMN is not directly associated with overall mindfulness, but rather demonstrates that there exists a close relationship between DMN and MW, and furthermore, that the involvement of mindfulness abilities in this dynamic may be secondary. In sum, our study contributes to a better understanding of the neural bases of spontaneous MW and its relationship with mindfulness. These results open up the possibility of intervening on specific aspects of our cognitive abilities: for example, our data suggest that training the mindfulness facet acting with awareness would allow lessening our tendency for MW at inopportune times.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: Interoception, the sensing, awareness, and regulation of physiological states, is crucial for wellbeing and mental health. Behavioural interventions targeting interoception exist, but randomised controlled trials (RCTs) testing efficacy remain limited. The present, preregistered (ISRCTN16762367) RCT tested the novel Interoceptive iNsight and Metacognitive Efficacy beliefs (InMe) intervention. InMe uses slow breathing and cardiac biofeedback during stress to train interoceptive self-efficacy beliefs and improve self-reported interoception. Methods: Healthy participants aged 18\u201330 years with low self-reported interoception were randomly assigned (1:1) to the InMe intervention (n = 50) or an active control (guided imagery; n = 52). Participants blinded to allocation were stratified by gender and disordered eating. Assessments included baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1), and 7\u20138 weeks post-intervention (T2). The primary outcome was the \u201cadaptive interoception\u201d factor of the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness questionnaire. Results: Both arms improved in the primary outcome at T1 (InMe: adjusted M difference = 5.76; 95% CI [\u22120.03; 11.56], p = 0.05; control: adjusted M difference = 7.90; 95% CI [1.92; 13.87], p = 0.002; marginal R2 = 0.09). However, only InMe sustained this improvement at T2 (InMe: adjusted M difference = 9.25, 95% CI [3.37; 15.13], p < 0.001; control: adjusted M difference = 2.94, 95% CI [\u22123.07; 8.96], p = 0.72), as indicated by a significant time*arm interaction (b = 6.31; SE = 2.92, 95% CI [0.56; 12.05], p < 0.03; marginal R2 = 0.12). Secondary outcomes showed a reduction in disordered eating scores across both arms at both time points (T1: b = \u22121.44, SE = 0.37, 95% CI [\u22122.17; \u22120.71], p < 0.001; T2: b = \u22121.05, SE = 0.37, 95% CI [\u22121.79; \u22120.32], p = 0.005). Conclusion: The InMe intervention selectively improved self-reported interoception at follow-up but did not outperform the control for secondary outcomes. Future research should explore its efficacy in clinical populations alongside complementary therapies.",

      "abstract": "Patients with fibromyalgia experience pain, cognitive dysfunction, and atypical interoception. However, it is still unclear whether the changes in interoceptive processes have consequences in managing cognitive tasks. The current study investigates the relationship between interoception and cognition in fibromyalgia. Twenty-nine fibromyalgia patients completed clinical questionnaires, the Digit-span, and the Stroop test. Interoceptive Accuracy (IAc) was measured by the heartbeat detection task, Interoceptive Awareness (IAw) via confidence ratings, and Interoceptive Sensibility (IS) via the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness questionnaire. IAc was found to be positively associated with Digit-span forward (p\u2009=\u20090.008), total (p\u2009=\u20090.004), and Stroop scores (all p\u2009\u2264\u20090.045). IS correlated negatively with Digit-span backward (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.\u2009\u2264\u20090.022) while IAw was negatively associated with Digit-span forward (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.034), total (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.008), and Stroop scores (all p\u2009\u2264\u20090.038). Moderation analysis revealed that IAc predicts Digit-span backward as symptom severity increases (p\u2009=\u20090.045). Despite the absence of a control group, this study provides evidence of the detailed relationships between interoception and cognitive abilities in fibromyalgia. While detecting and efficiently using body signals may be an essential tool for self-regulation in managing cognitive tasks, a higher ability to regulate body signals may exhaust cognition and predispose the patients to lower cognitive performance.",
