      "abstract": "Indigenous Peoples have cultivated and protected natural psychoactive medicines through ceremony, kinship, and spiritual responsibility across generations, yet their long-standing contributions have often been marginalized through extractive research, commercialization, and policy exclusion. It is Indigenous communities that have stewarded and gained expertise working with psychoactive medicines for centuries, yet they remain underrepresented within the scientific discourse. This commentary advances the case for reciprocal and equitable collaboration in psychedelic science, grounded in Indigenous sovereignty, cultural and intellectual property rights, and governance. Drawing on traditions involving ayahuasca, psilocybin, peyote, and iboga, we illustrate how Indigenous methodologies, including ritual, community-based practices, and ecological approaches, offer insights critical to both safety and efficacy. We argue that research and policy must embed free, prior, and informed consent, equitable benefit-sharing, and Indigenous leadership. Such efforts require moving past tokenistic inclusion toward meaningful collaboration and systemic change in psychedelic research that is both scientifically rigorous and culturally just. We conclude by calling for more formal, transparent, and globally legitimate convening processes, such as those modeled on WHO global consultations, that can bring Indigenous leaders, researchers, and policymakers together in dialogue. These steps represent profound acts of inclusion essential for these medicines to realize their full potential to heal and transform.",

      "abstract": "Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a chronic, multi-system condition affecting a substantial proportion of veterans deployed during the 1990-1991 Gulf War. Neurological complications, including cognitive impairment, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, depression, and migraine, represent a major clinical burden. Evidence implicates neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and epigenetic dysregulation as central mechanisms, with emerging data suggesting early tauopathy and sex-specific immune responses. Neuroimaging studies reveal hippocampal atrophy, white matter disruptions, and increased translocator protein (TSPO) binding, while biomarker analyses identify elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), leptin, and matrix metalloproteinases. Genetic factors, such as HLA alleles, may modulate susceptibility. Animal models corroborate these findings, demonstrating hippocampal dysfunction, neurotransmitter imbalance, and neuroimmune activation following exposure to Gulf War-related chemicals. Therapeutic evidence supports cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), exercise, and mindfulness-based interventions, with ongoing trials exploring vagus nerve stimulation, anti-inflammatory agents, and mitochondrial-targeted therapies. This review synthesizes current knowledge on GWI-related neurological dysfunction, highlights diagnostic and therapeutic advances, and underscores the need for biomarker-driven, sex-specific, and personalized approaches to improve outcomes for affected veterans.",

      "abstract": "The interactive effects of mindfulness and food characteristics on eating experiences remain poorly understood. This study examined whether a brief mindfulness intervention moderates the relationship between pasta quality and both hunger reduction and quality perception. Using a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 between-subjects factorial design, 128 participants consumed either Barilla's premium or classic pasta, with or without a 3.5-min guided meditation focusing on sensory awareness and gratitude during a blind tasting experience. Results revealed a consistent moderation pattern: control participants showed marked differences between pasta types in both hunger reduction and quality ratings, whereas mindfulness participants responded uniformly across pasta types. Specifically, control participants experienced significantly greater hunger reduction after consuming premium versus classic pasta (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008), and unexpectedly subjectively rated classic pasta as higher quality than premium (p\u00a0=\u00a00.034). In contrast, mindfulness participants showed equivalent responses to both pasta types across all measures (all ps\u00a0>\u00a00.40). This pattern replicated across three outcomes: hunger reduction, composite satiety scores, and quality perception, with control participants consistently showing pasta-type effects and mindfulness participants showing none. These findings suggest that brief mindfulness interventions may normalize eating responses by reducing automatic reactions to food characteristics. Rather than relying on external food characteristics or expectations, mindfulness may orient attention toward internal bodily signals of hunger and satiety. While replication in larger samples is warranted, the consistent pattern across multiple measures provides preliminary evidence that even brief mindfulness practices may enhance eating awareness and reduce expectation-driven biases in food quality perception.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Exercise is a recommended non-pharmacological approach to treat multiple sclerosis (MS) symptoms. Mind-body movement interventions (MBMIs) offer a multi-component exercise option that integrates movement, breathwork, and mindfulness. Using an umbrella review, we assessed the current best evidence on MBMIs (ai chi, dance, Pilates, qigong, tai chi, and yoga) for managing MS symptoms. RECENT FINDINGS: MBMIs significantly improved balance, equal to or superior to active controls (AC) or usual care (UC). Ai chi/tai chi/qigong significantly improved depression. Analyzed with other mind-body therapies, yoga reduced pain compared to AC/UC. Mixed results were found for fatigue. Physical function and quality of life were comparable to AC/UC. The certainty of evidence was low to very low for most MBMIs. Most reviews were \"critically low\" quality. MBMIs are commonly included in MS exercise reviews and may improve balance, pain, and depression. However, larger trials with active comparators and comprehensive reporting are needed to improve quality and certainty.",
