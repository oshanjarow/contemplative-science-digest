      "abstract": "Background: Contemplative practices encompass a variety of static and dynamic practices. These practices, by fostering insights, heightened awareness, and a deeper connection to a broader framework of meaning, may play a crucial role in significantly reducing trauma-related symptoms in both young and adult populations. Methods: The current narrative literature review used Scopus and PubMed to search for studies published between January 2018 and August 2023 that examined the effects of contemplative practices, an umbrella term that includes mindfulness-based interventions, yoga, tai chi, qigong, and meditation, on trauma recovery and PTSD symptoms among adults and youths. Results: The literature search identified 281 articles. Forty-two studies met the inclusion criteria and were critically evaluated. Among the various approaches, encompassing stand-alone contemplative practices and combined interventions, mindfulness emerged as the most employed and investigated practice for supporting trauma recovery. Contemplative practices have been shown to effectively reduce various dimensions of traumatic experience, such as reactivity, intrusion, hyperarousal, and negative cognitions and mood. Controversial results were found on avoidance symptoms and physiological parameters. Conclusions: The results give support to the idea of combining contemplative practices with trauma-focused psychotherapeutic interventions to foster a sense of safety and enhance emotional expression and awareness of feelings of fear, shame, guilt, or inferiority while improving metacognitive processes. This, in turn, supports healing the sense of self, restoring a sense of basic trust in self and others, which is often deeply affected in individuals who have experienced trauma.",

      "abstract": "The parent educational process was developed by implementing Participatory Action Research (PAR), using Contemplative Education and Positive Psychology Coaching approaches. Herein, our aim is to promote emotional well-being for preschoolers aged 3-6 years. Participants included 9 parents and 9 preschoolers who were involved in the process for seven months. Research instruments included parental self-assessment, semi-structured interview questions, short notes, and daily field notes. Data analysis encompassed both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Quantitative data were analyzed, using sums and averages, which were presented in a descriptive diagram. Qualitative data underwent content analysis. Findings revealed that the developed parent educational process consisted of five steps: 1) building a community of trust, 2) inner contemplation, 3) designing pathways, 4) enhancing understanding, and 5) disseminating participatory experiences. Seven driven strategies were carried out, comprising companionship, deep listening, network empowerment, collaborative decision-making, effective communication, powerful questioning, and continuum of practicing in daily life. The developed process demonstrated a structured yet adaptable design. It is noted that the nine parents who participated in the process became more competent in promoting emotional well-being for preschoolers. After implementing the process, preschoolers exhibited an increased level of emotional well-being.",

      "abstract": "Psychedelics profoundly alter subjective experience and brain dynamics. Brain oscillations express signatures of near-critical dynamics, relevant for healthy function. Alterations in the proximity to criticality have been suggested to underlie the experiential and neurological effects of psychedelics. Here, we investigate the effects of a psychedelic substance (DMT) on the criticality of brain oscillations, and in relation to subjective experience. We find that DMT shifts the dynamics of brain oscillations away from criticality in alpha and adjacent frequency bands. In this context, entropy is increased while complexity is reduced. We find that the criticality shifts observed in alpha and theta bands correlate with the intensity ratings of ego-dissolution, a hallmark of psychedelic experience. Finally, using a recently developed metric, the functional excitatory-inhibitory ratio, we find that the DMT-induced criticality shift in brain oscillations is towards subcritical regimes. These findings have major implications for the understanding of psychedelic mechanisms of action in the human brain and for the neurological basis of altered states of consciousness.",

      "abstract": "Ego dissolution\u2014the experience of losing one\u2019s sense of self\u2014is reported across a range of altered states, including psychedelic intoxication, meditative absorption, traumatic dissociation, and psychotic episodes. This paper proposes a unifying framework for these phenomena by introducing the concept of unlooping: the breakdown of recursive structures that construct and maintain identity. Drawing on models of recursive self-modeling, predictive processing, and enactive cognition, ego dissolution is interpreted as a graded suspension of feedback loops responsible for agency, continuity, and self-boundary. Through phenomenological analysis and cross-contextual case studies, the paper demonstrates that selfhood is not an ontological constant but a contingent, dynamically enacted achievement. Unlooping the self reveals both the fragility and plasticity of identity and offers new insights into the intersection of subjective experience and cognitive architecture. The implications span theoretical, methodological, and therapeutic domains, suggesting a revised account of selfhood that incorporates its capacity for suspension and reorganization",

      "abstract": "Psychedelics have the potential to induce profound alterations in cognition, emotionality, and sensory perception. The quality and intensity of these subjective effects exhibit high intra- and inter-individual variability, which can potentially be accounted for by the variability in contexts in which psychedelics are used. Therefore, the aim of the present cross-sectional study was to investigate how internal and external contextual factors are related to the subjective intensity of psychedelic-induced ego dissolution experiences. Participants completed an online survey in which they reported their motivations for past use of psychedelic substances, and the frequency of use in different environments and social contexts. Additionally, participants completed the Ego Dissolution Inventory to evaluate the intensity of past ego dissolution experiences. Robust linear regression analysis was performed on data from 862 psychedelics users (701\u00a0had used LSD and 553\u00a0had used psilocybin mushrooms); this revealed that participants consuming psychedelics for spiritual or self-healing purposes reported more intense, while those motivated by curiosity reported less intense ego dissolution experiences. However, the social context and physical environment did not exhibit robust associations with the reported ego dissolution. Therefore, our study enhances understanding of how set and setting factors relate to psychedelic-induced ego dissolution experiences in naturalistic contexts.",

      "abstract": "The direct dissolution of voloxidized used nuclear fuel (UNF) into an organic solution\u2014comprised of diluent and specialized extractants\u2014poses a promising alternative to the traditional liquid\u2013liquid solvent extraction approach to reprocessing UNF. However, moving to direct dissolution removes the presence of a concentrated nitric acid aqueous phase, which has been shown to significantly influence the radiolytic longevity of extractants in conventional extraction flowsheets. Given the limited knowledge of radiation effects under direct dissolution conditions, here we present a time-resolved and dose-accumulation study on the impact of direct dissolution conditions on the radiolytic longevity of two candidate butyramide extractants, N,N-di(2-ethylhexyl) butyramide (DEHBA) and N,N-di(2-ethylhexyl)isobutyramide (DEHiBA), in pre-equilibrated n-dodecane solvent in the presence and absence of process-relevant metal ions, specifically, uranium and rhenium. Loss G(DEHBA) and G(DEHiBA) values were found to be comparable to each other, with an average of 0.37 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcmol J\u20131, and to previous data from the \u03b3 irradiation of DEHBA and DEHiBA under conventional solvent extraction conditions. Rhenium, and by extension technetium, extraction had a modest decrease (\u223c10%) in the overall radiolytic stability of DEHiBA only, despite >2\u00d7 observed increases in chemical kinetic reactivity of the corresponding complexes with the n-dodecane radical cation. Uranium loading, on the other hand, significantly improved the lifetime of both ligands (>30%) under \u03b3 irradiation, with a greater stabilization observed for DEHBA over DEHiBA. The observed radioprotective effect afforded by uranium loading is fortuitous for the longevity of direct dissolution solvent.",

      "abstract": "A much\u2010emulated information commission and a superstar within global transparency policy circles, Mexico's National Institute for Access to Information (the INAI) wielded practically unappealable decision\u2010making power over public information across the entire Mexican federation. In November 2024, the populist Morena regime formally dissolved the INAI. Looking beyond the tired tale of populist backsliding, the INAI's demise offers key lessons about the vulnerability of transparency in the absence of adequate social and institutional embeddedness. While the INAI exceled at freeing information from the state, exposed abuses went unaccompanied by broader linked efforts at enforcement. Lesson: Integrate public transparency into broader policy agendas, especially those popularly associated with transparency's raison d\u2019\u00eatre (e.g., social, administrative,\u00a0criminal justice). And while the INAI did make efforts to socialize the right to information, these lacked scale and arrived too late. Lesson: Engage citizens early, making transparency relevant to the problem\u2010solving tasks of everyday civic life.",

      "abstract": "Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (dDNP) is a powerful hyperpolarization technique enabling sensitivity gains beyond 4 orders of magnitude in solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Over the last decades, researchers' efforts have led to an extension of dDNP applications in numerous research fields. Lithium-ion batteries are one of the most widespread types of rechargeable batteries, which calls for a deeper understanding of the various physicochemical mechanisms involved in making them more efficient, safe, and sustainable. One of the key challenges lies in better understanding the degradation of the battery electrolyte to mitigate it, as it can significantly impact the battery's performance. While NMR has been used in attempts to understand these mechanisms, notably by investigating the degradation products, the intrinsic lack of sensitivity of this technique, combined with the limited accessible volume of such compounds, makes its application often challenging. In this work, we combine several state-of-the-art dDNP methodologies, including the use of recently introduced hyperpolarizing polymers (HYPOPs), to acquire hyperpolarized 13C NMR spectra of battery electrolytes. We show that we can successfully detect 13C signals on formulated battery electrolyte solutions in different degradation stages on a 600 MHz spectrometer, with sensitivity gains of up to 3 orders of magnitude. This work paves the way for studying lithium-ion battery electrolyte degradation under real usage conditions (cycling, thermal aging, air exposure, etc.) with a 13C detection limit below the micromolar range. This methodology has the potential to provide new insights into degradation mechanisms and the role and effectiveness of additives to mitigate electrolyte degradation.",

      "abstract": "There has been growing interest in understanding the psychological effects of psychedelic experiences, including their potential to catalyze significant shifts in moral cognition. This retrospective study examines how meaningful psychedelic experiences are related to changes in moral expansiveness and investigates the role of acute subjective effects as predictors of these changes. We found that meaningful psychedelic experiences were associated with self-reported increases in moral expansiveness. Changes in moral expansiveness were positively correlated with reported mystical experiences, ego dissolution, as well as feeling moved and admiration during the experience. Additionally, heightened moral expansiveness was associated with longer term shifts in the propensity to experience the self-transcendent positive emotions of admiration and awe. Future research should further investigate the mechanisms underlying these changes and explore how different types of psychedelic experiences might influence moral decision-making and behavior over time.",

      "abstract": "Background: This study aimed to validate and culturally adapt the Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale (OAV) and Five Dimensional\u2014Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire (5D-ASC) for Brazilian Portuguese to measure altered states of consciousness in the context of psychedelic research. Methods: A parallel back-translation model was employed with expert reviews to ensure linguistic and cultural accuracy. The finalized version was pre-tested with 10 participants and subsequently included in an online survey. This survey was completed by 3762 respondents recounting their psychedelic experiences. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were conducted to identify the factor structure and validate the scales. Internal consistency and convergent validity were assessed through correlation with the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ) and Ego Dissolution Inventory (EDI). Results: The analyses confirmed an 11-factor structure for the OAV and a 6-factor structure for the 5D-ASC, both exhibiting strong internal consistency (\u03b1\u2009>\u20090.76). Significant correlations were observed between OAV and 5D-ASC factors and the MEQ and EDI, indicating solid convergent validity. Differences in factor scores were noted depending on the substance, setting, and meditation frequency, with higher oceanic boundlessness and anxious ego-dissolution scores for ayahuasca and dimethyltryptamine experiences. Conclusions: The validated scales demonstrated reliable psychometric properties for the Brazilian context. The results highlight cultural aspects influencing subjective experiences with psychedelics. Limitations include sample homogeneity and potential recall bias. Future research should involve more diverse samples to confirm and extend these findings.",

      "abstract": "This study focused on the nature of rare earth metal complex compounds that can form during the carbonate\u2013alkaline processing of industrial waste materials, such as phosphogypsum and red mud, at 70\u2013100 \u00b0C and 1\u201310 atm. Experimental findings revealed that the dissolution of synthetic carbonates of rare earth elements (REEs) in a concentrated carbonate-ion medium (3 mol/L) leads to the formation of ion-associates of varying strengths. Light (lanthanum, praseodymium, and neodymium) and medium (samarium) REE groups exhibited a tendency to form loose ion-associates, whereas heavy REEs (terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, lutetium, and yttrium) formed close ion-associates. To confirm the existence of these ion-associates, the specific conductivity of solutions was measured after dissolving thulium (III) and samarium (III) carbonates at phase ratios ranging from 1:2000 g/mL to 1:40 g/mL in a potassium carbonate medium. The decay of ion-associates, leading to the precipitation of rare earth metal (III) carbonates, was tested in an ammonium carbonate medium. Thermal decomposition of ammonium carbonate at 70\u201375 \u00b0C during 1\u20134 h was accompanied by full rare earth carbonates\u2019 sedimentation and its in-the-way separation into groups because of the varied strength of ion-associates. The results of this study provide a basis for developing processes to separate rare earth metals into groups during their carbonate\u2013alkaline extraction into solution.",

These filters include sensory receptors, the ascending reticular activating system and the thalamus, the default mode network, and left hemisphere language centers. These filters limit our perception of the world to a narrow range of energy frequencies, make sense of space and time, and prioritize internally generated narratives (associated with language and conceptuality). We then present studies indicating that when the activity within these filters is reduced or absent\u2014such as in near-death experiences, deep meditation, or the use of psychedelic compounds\u2014we may gain access to a wider awareness, experience transcendence of time and space, and ego dissolution. This expanded state might enable the mind to potentially access intuitive, nonlocal information beyond the limitations of the five senses.",

      "abstract": "The symbolic architecture of non-ordinary consciousness remains largely unmapped in cognitive science and artificial intelligence. While conventional models prioritize rational coherence, altered states such as those induced by psychedelics reveal distinct symbolic regimes characterized by recursive metaphor, ego dissolution, and semantic destabilization. We present \\textit{Glyph}, a generative symbolic interface designed to simulate psilocybin-like symbolic cognition in large language models. Rather than modeling perception or mood, Glyph enacts symbolic transformation through recursive reentry, metaphoric modulation, and entropy-scaled destabilization -- a triadic operator formalized within a tensorial linguistic framework. Experimental comparison with baseline GPT-4o reveals that Glyph consistently generates high-entropy, metaphor-saturated, and ego-dissolving language across diverse symbolic prompt categories. These results validate the emergence of non-ordinary cognitive patterns and support a new paradigm for simulating altered consciousness through language. Glyph opens novel pathways for modeling symbolic cognition, exploring metaphor theory, and encoding knowledge in recursively altered semantic spaces.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background The REBUS (RElaxed Beliefs Under pSychedelics) and the anarchic brain model of psychedelic drug action proposes that confidence in beliefs \u2013 and thus expectations (priors) \u2013 are relaxed under these drugs. The brain makes inferences to minimize surprise, or discrepant expectations and outcomes (prediction error [PE]), and better model the world. We recently showed that the non-specific 5-HT2A receptor agonist LSD heightened sensitivity to PEs, reflected by speeded updating of value representations following better and worse than expected outcomes. Indeed, events that are surprising are inherently less expected. There is evidence that LSD produces ego dissolution that is positively correlated with disintegration of the default mode network (DMN), assessed using resting state functional connectivity (RSFC), and is correlated inversely with alpha oscillatory power. The DMN has been proposed to be a seat at the ego\u2019s table and decreased alpha power has been posited to reflect relaxation of the cognitive hierarchy, mediated by 5-HT2A receptors on deep layer V pyramidal neurons in cortex. Aims & Objectives Here we aim to demonstrate neural correlates of an objective, behaviorally derived marker of REBUS. Greater speed at which choice value increased following a reward PE \u2013 higher reward learning rates (RLRs) \u2013 was operationalized as enhanced sensitivity to surprise. We tested whether medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) RSFC within the DMN \u2013 a region often associated with value \u2013 and diminished alpha power correlated significantly with the RLR. Method Alpha power was derived from magnetoencephalography (MEG). The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) data of interest were extracted from mPFC regions of the DMN. To assess anatomical specificity, we also predicted that static RSFC of primary visual cortex (V1) would not be correlated with the RLR. We additionally extended our analysis to the brain\u2019s temporal organization, parsing the data into dynamic states where network integration or segregation predominate, again focusing on mPFC regions of the DMN. Results The RLR was inversely correlated with MEG alpha power (r(13) = -.618, p = .024), and positively correlated with the extent of disintegration of the DMN as assessed using static RSFC (r(15) = .641, p = .010). V1 static RSFC did not correlate with the RLR, as hypothesized (r(15) = .204, p = .465). The RLR was positively correlated with dynamic RSFC in a mPFC a priori region of interest during a predominantly integrated sub-state of brain dynamics (r(15) = .624, p = .013). Discussion & Conclusions A behaviorally derived computational marker of surprise was correlated with neural signatures of relaxed beliefs under psychedelics (REBUS).",

      "abstract": "The Bardo Thodol (bar do thos grol), commonly known in the West as The Tibetan Book of the Dead, has traditionally served as a spiritual manual guiding consciousness through the postmortem bardo (bar do) states toward liberation or rebirth. While prior interpretations have framed the text in ritualistic, psychological, or mystical terms, this essay proposes an original and interdisciplinary expansion: that the bardo model can serve as a framework for understanding digital identity dissolution and transformation. Drawing from Tibetan Buddhist thought, extended mind theory, digital anthropology, and cognitive science, this study reinterprets the bardo states as phenomenological thresholds that manifest not only in physical death but also in virtual liminality\u2014moments of radical ego disintegration, avatar deconstruction, and reidentification in digital and augmented environments. By mapping the six bardos onto digital experiences, this paper presents a unique synthesis of esoteric Tibetan metaphysics and contemporary posthuman theory, offering new insights into consciousness, ethical selfhood, and the future of identity.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Deleuze\u2019s philosophy, celebrated for its affirmation of life, also offers a profound and nuanced exploration of death, challenging conventional understandings of individuality and existence. Through key concepts such as the \u201cdeath drive,\u201d the \u201cvirtual,\u201d and \u201cassemblage,\u201d Deleuze frames death not as a terminus, but as an integral process within life itself. This article critically examines Deleuze\u2019s conception of death in three main stages. First, I explore how Deleuze characterizes the ego as a metastable entity \u2013 inherently fragile and prone to disintegration. This implies that we are always already embedded in processes that draw us into larger becomings, dissolving fixed identities. Next, I differentiate this perspective from spiritual traditions that emphasize ego dissolution. I argue that Deleuze\u2019s framework, while grounded in a secular, intellectual engagement with worldly involvement, offers insights that could enrich spiritual discourse. Finally, I also identify limitations in his approach. Deleuze\u2019s intense focus on the creation of the new often overlooks what he terms the \u201cfirst death,\u201d which aligns with traditional conceptions of mortality as an absolute end. He appears to neglect the possibility of a final cessation of all processes, such as the heat death of the cosmos. After presenting the practical implications of these considerations for religious life, I conclude by addressing various points of contact between these reflections and other intellectual currents. While Deleuze\u2019s philosophy may not serve as a definitive framework for understanding death, engaging with his ideas provides insightful and novel perspectives on existence. It encourages a reexamination of the boundaries between life and death from an immanent standpoint, enriching traditional perspectives.",

Through a transdisciplinary approach integrating theopoetics, mystical paths, and sexuality, the text critically reflects on reconstructing spirituality amid technological dominance and data-driven logic. Theopoetics reimagines God not as an absolute entity but as an \u201cevent\u201d manifest in everyday experiences, while Meister Eckhart\u2019s mysticism emphasizes union with God (Unio Mystica) through ego dissolution and contemplative silence. The body and sexuality are positioned as mediums of transcendence, overcoming spirit-matter dualism, and fostering spiritual inclusivity amid diverse gender identities and sexual orientations. Challenges faced by Generation Z and Alpha in the digital age, such as alienation and existential void, are addressed through anatheism, which embraces doubt and cross-boundary dialogue. The document concludes that future spirituality must be inclusive, dialogical, and rooted in unconditional love, where God is present not through dogma but in grounded human relations. Principles like respect, compassion, sensitivity, and intimacy serve as pillars for building new spiritual spaces in the digital world.\u00a0\nAbstrakArtikel ini mengeksplorasi konsep Tuhan yang termarginalkan dalam konteks modernitas dan postmodernitas, di mana sekularisasi dipahami bukan sebagai penghapusan agama melainkan sebagai transformasi relasi manusia dengan Yang Ilahi. Melalui pendekatan transdisipliner yang mengintegrasikan teopoetika, jalur-jalur mistik, dan seksualitas, teks ini merefleksikan secara kritis upaya rekonstruksi spiritualitas di tengah dominasi teknologi dan logika berbasis data. Teopoetika menghadirkan ulang Tuhan bukan sebagai entitas absolut melainkan sebagaisebuah \u201cperistiwa\u201d (event) yang termanifestasi dalam pengalaman sehari-hari. Sementara itu, mistisisme Meister Eckhart menekankan penyatuan dengan Tuhan (Unio Mystica) melalui pelenyapan ego dan kesunyian kontemplatif. Tubuh dan seksualitas diposisikan sebagai medium transendensi, mengatasi dualisme spirit-materi, serta memupuk inklusivitas spiritual di tengah beragam identitas gender dan orientasi seksual. Tantangan yang dihadapi Generasi Z dan Alpha di era digital\u2014seperti alienasi dan kehampaan eksistensial, yang merangkul keraguan dan dialog lintas-batas. Dokumen ini menyimpulkan bahwa spiritualitas masa depan harus bersifat inklusif, dialogis, dan berakar pada cinta tanpa syarat, di mana Tuhan hadir bukan melalui dogma melainkan dalam relasi manusia yang membumi.

      "abstract": "Contemporary interpretations of psychedelic spirituality are dominated by the \u201cmystical experience model,\u201d which emphasizes that psychedelics can lead to well-being through bringing about ego dissolution and a unitive mystical experience. Rooted in perennialist and dualist assumptions\u2014often derived from Christian mysticism, Vedanta, and Plotinian Neoplatonism\u2014this framework has shaped both scientific discourse and popular understanding of psychedelic states. However, the mystical experience model is controversial: (1) secular critics consider it as too religious; (2) it is a form of mystical exceptionalism, narrowly focusing on only certain extraordinary experiences; (3) its ontological assumptions include a Cartesian separation between internal experience and external reality and a perennialist focus on ultimate reality; (4) it neglects psychedelic learning processes; (5) in the ritual and ceremonial use of psychedelics, shared intentionality and practices of sacred participation are more important than the induction of individual mystical experiences. This article proposes an alternative and complementary model grounded in theurgy, based on the Neoplatonism of Iamblichus and the participatory ontological pluralism of Bruno Latour. Unlike the mystical experience model, which privileges individual unitary experiences, theurgy affirms ritual mediation, ritual competence, and both individual and collective transformation. Theurgic ritual practice makes room for the encounter with autonomous entities (framed by Latour as \u201cbeings of religion\u201d) that are often reported by participants in psychedelic ceremonies. By examining how the theurgic framework can expand our understanding of psychedelic spirituality in a way that is truer to psychedelic phenomenology, especially the presence of autonomous entities, imaginal realms, and the centrality of intention and ritual, this article argues that theurgy offers a nuanced and experientially congruent framework that complements the mystical experience model. Framing psychedelic spirituality through theurgic lenses opens space for a vision of the sacred that is not about escaping the world into undifferentiated unity, but about individual and collective transformation in communion with a living, differentiated cosmos.",

This paper aims to compare the PES with a range of established questionnaires designed to evaluate the psychedelic experience. Data were gathered from three separate studies in which a 5-MeO-DMT formulation (GH001) was administered via pulmonary inhalation to healthy volunteers and patients with treatment resistant depression (N\u202f=\u202f84) as either single doses (0 [placebo], 2, 6, 12, 18\u202fmg) or an incremental individualized dosing regimen (IDR). Apart from the PES, participants also completed the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ-30), the Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ), the Ego Dissolution Inventory (EDI) and the 5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale (5D-ASC). The 5-MeO-DMT formulation produced a significant, dose-related increase in PES ratings, with maximal ratings being achieved after the IDR. A principal component analysis (PCA) of the PES items identified a single primary component explaining 83.5% of the variance. PES items also displayed a strong internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1\u202f=\u202f0.896). A PCA across all questionnaires indicated a strong and unidimensional loading of the PES, MEQ, EDI and the 5D-ASC, suggesting high interrelatedness. Likewise, individual ratings on the PES were highly correlated to those on the PES, MEQ, EDI and the 5D-ASC, but not the CEQ. The PES is concluded to be an effective tool to rapidly assess the strength of the psychedelic experience with 5-MeO-DMT. The PES could prove useful to gain fast insight into the strength of a psychedelic dose in individual patients and potentially guide dose and re-dose selection of rapid-acting psychedelics.",

This study examined whether therapeutic experiences originally created in the MindGym could maintain their efficacy when delivered via 360-degree recordings through virtual reality (VR) headsets. A randomized controlled trial (N=126) compared anxiety reduction, cognitive performance, and physiological responses across four conditions: MindGym and VR platforms, each delivering either breathwork or rain stimuli. Results demonstrated significant improvements across all conditions in cognitive performance (Trail Making Test RTACC, p.fdr<.001; Architex Total Speed, p.fdr<.001) and anxiety reduction (STAI, p.fdr<.001). Breathwork conditions produced greater decreases in breath rate compared to rain stimuli (p.fdr=.002). Treatment responses were moderated by individual differences, with absorption (MODTAS) predicting both awe (p.fdr=.004) and ego dissolution (p.fdr=.015), while openness to experience interacted with stimuli type to influence anxiety reduction (p.fdr=.038). The anxiolytic effects originally generated in the MindGym maintained full efficacy when translated to VR delivery, with no significant differences in effectiveness or immersion between the original environment and its virtual reproduction. These findings establish the MindGym as a viable content creation platform for immersive, anxiety-reducing experiences that can be successfully adapted to more accessible delivery systems, while highlighting the potential for personalization based on individual differences. Future research should investigate the translation of more complex MindGym-generated experiences to expand accessible anxiety management tools.",

      "abstract": "Psilocybin, an indoleamine alkaloid derived from various fungal species, is the subject of renewed, rigorous investigation for its therapeutic potential in psychiatry. This compound, a prodrug for the active metabolite psilocin, functions primarily as a partial agonist at the serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor. Its administration within a structured psychotherapeutic context is associated with rapid and sustained antidepressant and anxiolytic effects, particularly in populations with treatment-resistant depression and existential distress related to life-threatening illnesses. The neurobiological mechanisms are multifaceted, initiated by acute 5-HT2A-mediated disruption of key brain networks, most importantly the Default Mode Network (DMN). This network destabilization correlates with subjective experiences of ego dissolution and is hypothesized to create a state of elevated brain entropy. This acute phase is followed by a period of enhanced neuroplasticity, driven by downstream signaling pathways involving BDNF and mTOR, which promotes synaptogenesis and dendritic spine growth in cortical neurons. This \"window of plasticity\" may facilitate the unlearning of maladaptive cognitive patterns and the formation of new, adaptive associations. Clinical trials demonstrate significant efficacy, though psychological risks necessitate careful screening, preparation, and a supportive therapeutic environment. The translation of psilocybin-assisted therapy from research to clinical practice presents challenges related to protocol optimization, clinician training, and scalability",

      "abstract": "This article explores the profound connections between mathematics and Sufism (Faqar), revealing how both disciplines embody principles of balance, unity, and divine order. While mathematics provides a logical framework to understand the physical world through patterns, symmetry, and equations, Sufism offers a spiritual lens to perceive the deeper meaning behind these structures, emphasizing humility, love, and connection with Allah. The article draws parallels between mathematical concepts such as zero, infinity, the Fibonaccisequence, and geometric shapes and Sufi teachings on ego dissolution, eternal divine mercy, and the symbolism of the circle as a representation of Allah\u2019s unity. Through Qur\u2019anic verses, Hadith, and insights from Sunni scholars likeImam Ghazali, Rumi, and Ibn Arabi, the study illustrates how mathematical truths mirror spiritual truths, guiding seekers toward inner harmony and divine realization. Examples include the role of zero in mathematics and Sufi concepts of humility (fana), the infinite as a metaphor for Allah\u2019s boundless mercy, and the straight path (Sirat al-Mustaqeem) as both a geometric and spiritual ideal. The article concludes that mathematics and Sufism are complementary paths to truth: one appeals to the intellect, theother to the heart, together leading to a holistic understanding of creation and the Creator.",

      "abstract": "This article examines the integration of mysticism, spirituality, Sufism, and neurotheology as a means to bridge the spiritual and biological dimensions of human religious experience. Mysticism is interpreted as the pinnacle of transrational religious experience, while spirituality is viewed as a progressive development of ethical and inner consciousness. Sufism, as the mystical path of Islam, offers a structured and practical framework of spiritual ascent through concepts such as maqamat (stations), ahwal (states), dhikr (remembrance), and fana\u2019 (ego dissolution). This study employs a qualitative approach, utilising a literature review and philosophical-interpretive content analysis, to examine classical Sufi texts and contemporary neuroscientific research. The findings suggest that Sufi practices are associated with specific neurological activities, including activation of the prefrontal cortex, increased theta waves, and decreased activity in the default mode network. The integration of Sufism and neurotheology supports the development of transdisciplinary models in spiritual education and psychological therapy, while maintaining epistemological boundaries and the depth of spiritual meaning. This article contributes to the interdisciplinary discourse of religious studies, opening up space for a constructive dialogue between revelation and science.",

The research focuses on the Prema-margi branch of Bhakti, which emphasizes love-based devotion to deities with form, contrasting with the knowledge-based Gyan-margi tradition. This paper demonstrates how Bhakti traditions foster community engagement, compassion and emotional transformation through participatory devotional activities that transcend social boundaries. This has significant implications for management practices through service-oriented leadership models and emotional intelligence frameworks derived from various bhavas. The tradition's emphasis on ego dissolution, selfless service and authentic devotion provides valuable insights for an ethical living at both the individual and leadership levels.",

      "abstract": "Oceanic states of consciousness\u2014characterized by ego dissolution, unity, and timelessness\u2014have long occupied a liminal space between psychopathology and transcendence. This paper explores these states through the interdisciplinary lens of existential neuroscience, integrating insights from psychoanalysis, existentialism, affective neuroscience, and psychedelic research. Starting with the psychoanalytic tension between Freud\u2019s view of the oceanic feeling as a regressive illusion and Jung\u2019s framing of it as a transformative encounter with the unconscious, this paper examines how creative and mystical experiences often arise from this dissolution of self-boundaries. Drawing on art theorist Anton Ehrenzweig and examples from figures like Vincent van Gogh and Antonin Artaud, I highlight how oceanic states may catalyze both visionary insight and psychological disintegration. Neuroscientific models, including the REBUS theory and studies of the Default Mode Network (DMN), suggest that ego dissolution reflects a flexible reorganization of brain function rather than dysfunction. The Peri-Aqueductal Gray (PAG), a midbrain structure associated with affect regulation and spiritual experience, emerges as a key neural hub linking primal affective states with mystical awareness. Existential thinkers such as Sartre, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty provide a philosophical framework for interpreting these phenomena as moments of existential rupture and potential authenticity. Oceanic states thus challenge conventional notions of the self as fixed and bounded. Rather than categorizing them as pathological or purely mystical, it is proposed here that these states represent affectively charged boundary experiences - ones that require contextual integration and offer deep insight into the nature of selfhood, meaning, and transformation.",

      "abstract": "This study explores the applicability of the 22 cards of the Tarot Major Arcana as a symbolic tool for self-exploration in counseling, grounded in C.G. Jung\u2019s individuation theory. Individuation, as conceptualized by Jung, is a psychological journey toward the integration of the ego and the Self, encompassing symbolic stages such as ego separation, confrontation with the shadow, ego dissolution and reconstruction, and ultimately, self-realization. From a depth psychological perspective, this study analyzes the symbolic structure of the Major Arcana and compares it with the stages of the individuation process. The sequential progression of the Major Arcana reveals a structural and symbolic parallel to Jung\u2019s individuation journey, suggesting that each card can function as a medium for engaging with specific psychological tasks and inner transformations. Based on this framework, the process of individuation counseling is restructured into five stages: departure, initiation, collapse, recovery, and integration. This study highlights the potential of the Major Arcana to serve as a guiding symbolic system within counseling, offering a model for individuation that facilitates inner integration and symbolic transformation.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Given the large treatment gap and modest response to contemporary drug treatment approaches for adolescents, interest in mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) for this population is growing. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the extant literature on the efficacy of MBIs in reducing alcohol/drug use and improving psychological functioning in youth who use substances (YWUS) using PRISMA guidelines. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. STUDY SELECTION: Selected studies used randomized controlled trial (RCT) designs to compare the efficacy of an MBI to a comparator intervention on substance-related outcomes in samples of YWUS (12-21\u00a0years). DATA EXTRACTION: Extracted data included design features, sample characteristics, outcome variables, source measures, and characteristics of MBI and control conditions. RESULTS: After reviewing 2090 citations, we identified 23 eligible studies reporting results from 21 trials with 2297 participants. There was a high degree of heterogeneity across designs, analytic approaches, MBI types, and populations studied. Over two-thirds of studies reported positive results favoring MBI over comparator conditions for postintervention substance use reductions and pooled substance use outcomes. Subgroup results provided preliminary evidence that MBI may reduce impulsivity and alter responses to stress and craving, and that these changes may mediate the relationship between MBI receipt and substance outcomes in YWUS. LIMITATIONS: Few studies examined intervention impacts on illicit substances, and heterogeneity of interventions and outcomes limited the ability to generalize findings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that MBIs can produce small to moderate reductions in alcohol/drug use and may improve impulsivity and stress reactivity in YWUS.",
