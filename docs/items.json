      "abstract": "Breast cancer causes numerous physical complications and mental stress that negatively impact patients\u2019 performance and quality of life. This study examined the effects of mindfulness-integrated cognitive behavior therapy (MICBT) on depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep quality in women with breast cancer. A clinical trial design with pre-tests and post-tests and a two-month follow-up were used in the current study. The target population was women with breast cancer, 30 of whom were selected through purposeful sampling. Then, 15 participants were placed in the intervention group and 15 in the control group with four random blocks. Those in the intervention group received mindfulness-integrated cognitive behavior therapy, while those in the control group received self-help (an educational book). Demographic questionnaires, the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to collect data. Descriptive statistics such as frequency, mean and standard deviation, repeated measures ANOVA, and the Bonferroni test were used to analyze the data. The maximum alpha error level was considered 0.05 to test the hypotheses (p\u2009\u2265\u20090.05). The results showed the effectiveness of MICBT therapy on depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep quality (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The mean scores decreased in all variables, including from 15.47\u2009\u00b1\u20091.77 in the pre-test to 11.33\u2009\u00b1\u20094.25 in the post-test for depression, from 13.20\u2009\u00b1\u20092.60 in the pre-test to 8.67\u2009\u00b1\u20094.19 in the post-test for anxiety, from 19.73\u2009\u00b1\u20091.98 in the pre-test to 14.67\u2009\u00b1\u20092.69 in the post-test for stress and from 9.20\u2009\u00b1\u20091.74 in the pre-test to 5.07\u2009\u00b1\u20092.05 in the post-test for sleep quality. Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that MICBT therapy is effective in reducing depression, anxiety, and stress and improving sleep quality in women with breast cancer. Therefore, it is recommended that affected women use psychological treatments such as MICBT in addition to medical treatments to deal with this stressful and challenging disease. MICBT can improve mood, offer a new cognitive and behavioral system, change patients\u2019 habits and thought patterns, and improve their lifestyle.",

      "abstract": "Dubai and Sharjah, twin cities of the United Arab Emirates, offer a diverse living environment, attracting residents from around the globe. Despite their cosmopolitan nature, these emirates have a concerning rate of fire incidents. To address fire-related issues, the public and private sectors provide extensive fire safety training/workshops and run awareness campaigns. The increase in fire incidents has been encouraged by the possible deficiencies in these training programs; a survey was conducted to assess the effectiveness of available training resources. Employing basic statistics and thematic analysis, we collected data from 149 participants. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of fire safety training programs provided by different organizations in Dubai and Sharjah. The proposed survey had 12 questions about fire safety training and awareness campaigns run in the Dubai and Sharjah Emirates, yielding valuable insights. The lack of adequate fire safety training among the residents of Dubai and Sharjah was revealed through thematic analysis. Conventional approaches in training, such as PowerPoint slides, brochures, and discussions, make the training passive learning. Residents wait for the opportunity to attend fire safety training, and it happens rarely. The available training often lacks contextual learning and inclusion of technological resources. Residents of Dubai and Sharjah rely on their employers or the public sector to sponsor their fire safety training. Additionally, many residents use search engines to learn about fire safety, unaware of existing awareness campaigns. Survey respondents in larger workshops frequently complained about limited individual attention, the long duration of these workshops, participants' education level, time constraints, and the language of instruction. These are the major causes of difficulties in the fire safety training. Most residents recommended incorporating mobile, augmented, and virtual reality applications to make training safe, contextually rich, engaging, and motivating. The survey results supported practical demonstrations, smartphone-enabled training, and augmented and virtual reality-based training over leaflets, PowerPoint presentations, and discussion. Age, gender, and qualification variables were used to establish relationships with the survey responses using thematic analysis to improve fire safety training and awareness campaigns. However, the question left unanswered by respondents requires further investigation to address the gaps and how technology, such as augmented and virtual reality, can transform perception of awareness campaigns by integrating contextual learning, motivation, and engagement.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: While ample evidence supports the protective function of mindfulness against mental health problems among adolescents, there is a scarcity of studies elucidating which elements of mindfulness play a crucial role. Network analysis provides approaches to investigate such detailed associations among those variables in a more meticulous way. The current study aimed to model a cross-lagged network of components of mindfulness (i.e., awareness without judgment and acceptance) and mental health problems (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress) with longitudinal data to unveil their temporal relationships among adolescents. METHOD: A sample of 1158 adolescents (M RESULTS: Anxiety was the strongest and most consistent predictor of subsequent stress across both networks and centrality analysis identified anxiety as the most influential node over time. Nonjudgmental awareness consistently acted as a protective factor against mental health problems, while its relationship with acceptance evolved from being predictive to mutually reinforcing over time. CONCLUSIONS: The study underscores the dynamic interplay between mindfulness and adolescent mental health, with anxiety emerging as the most central node within the network. Accordingly, mindfulness-based interventions may initially emphasize the cultivation of nonjudgmental awareness as a foundational strategy to promote adolescent well-being.",
