      "abstract": "ABSTRACT To investigate the impact of mindfulness training on mindfulness, psychological resilience, flow state, subjective well-being, sports anxiety, sports depression, and psychological fatigue among elite athletes through a meta-analysis. Databases like PubMed, Web of Science, and others were searched for randomized controlled trials up to October 31, 2024. Included studies compared mindfulness training interventions to non-mindfulness training in elite athletes. The outcome indicators were analyzed using Review Manager 5.4 software. Among 6917 articles, 32 studies with 1108 athletes (560 experimental, 548 control) were included. Mindfulness training significantly improved mindfulness (p<0.01), psychological resilience (p<0.05), flow state (p<0.01), sports anxiety (p<0.01), sports depression (p<0.01), and psychological fatigue dimensions (p<0.01) but not subjective well-being (p>0.05). MAC, MAIC, MBSP, and MT were effective for mindfulness. The best intervention duration was 7 weeks, with sessions lasting over 60 minutes once a week. MAC was best for psychological resilience. MBSP, MT, and MAC improved flow state. MBSP and MT alleviated anxiety, while MBSR was effective for depression. MAIC training mitigated psychological fatigue. Mindfulness training positively impacts elite athletes\u2019 psychological state, enhancing mindfulness, resilience, flow, and alleviating anxiety, depression, and psychological fatigue, but not subjective well-being. Optimal methods and durations vary by outcome.",

      "abstract": "Critical maritime infrastructure increasingly demands situational awareness both above and below the surface, yet existing''seabed-to-sky''mapping pipelines either rely on GNSS (vulnerable to shadowing/spoofing) or expensive bathymetric sonars. We present a unified, GNSS-independent mapping system that fuses LiDAR-IMU with a dual, orthogonally mounted Forward Looking Sonars (FLS) to generate consistent seabed-to-sky maps from an Autonomous Surface Vehicle. On the acoustic side, we extend orthogonal wide-aperture fusion to handle arbitrary inter-sonar translations (enabling heterogeneous, non-co-located models) and extract a leading edge from each FLS to form line-scans. On the mapping side, we modify LIO-SAM to ingest both stereo-derived 3D sonar points and leading-edge line-scans at and between keyframes via motion-interpolated poses, allowing sparse acoustic updates to contribute continuously to a single factor-graph map. We validate the system on real-world data from Belvederekanalen (Copenhagen), demonstrating real-time operation with approx. 2.65 Hz map updates and approx. 2.85 Hz odometry while producing a unified 3D model that spans air-water domains.",

      "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently set new benchmarks in Speech Enhancement (SE). However, most existing score-based models treat speech spectrograms merely as generic 2D images, applying uniform processing that ignores the intrinsic structural sparsity of audio, which results in inefficient spectral representation and prohibitive computational complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose DVPD, an extremely lightweight Dual-View Predictive Diffusion model, which uniquely exploits the dual nature of spectrograms as both visual textures and physical frequency-domain representations across both training and inference stages. Specifically, during training, we optimize spectral utilization via the Frequency-Adaptive Non-uniform Compression (FANC) encoder, which preserves critical low-frequency harmonics while pruning high-frequency redundancies. Simultaneously, we introduce a Lightweight Image-based Spectro-Awareness (LISA) module to capture features from a visual perspective with minimal overhead. During inference, we propose a Training-free Lossless Boost (TLB) strategy that leverages the same dual-view priors to refine generation quality without any additional fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that DVPD achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring only 35% of the parameters and 40% of the inference MACs compared to SOTA lightweight model, PGUSE. These results highlight DVPD's superior ability to balance high-fidelity speech quality with extreme architectural efficiency.

      "abstract": "Orbit determination for non-cooperative targets represents a significant focus of research within the domain of space situational awareness. In contrast to cooperative targets, non-cooperative targets do not provide their orbital parameters, necessitating the use of observation data for accurate orbit determination. The increasing prevalence of low-cost, low-thrust spacecraft has heightened the demand for advancements in real-time orbit determination and parameter estimation for low-thrust maneuvers. This paper presents a novel dual-layer filter approach designed to facilitate real-time acceleration estimation for non-cooperative targets. Initially, the method employs a square-root cubature Kalman filter (SRCKF) to handle the nonlinearity of the system and a Jerk model to address the challenges in acceleration modeling, thereby yielding a preliminary estimation of the acceleration produced by the thruster of the non-cooperative target. Subsequently, a specialized filtering structure is established for the estimated acceleration, and two filtering frameworks are integrated into a dual-layer filter model via the cubature transform, significantly enhancing the estimation accuracy of acceleration parameters. Finally, to adapt to the potential on/off states of the thrusters, the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) algorithm is employed to bolster the robustness of the proposed solution. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving real-time orbit determination and acceleration estimation.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Peoples and Rundel argue that oceanic experiences in psychedelic-assisted treatment need not indicate regression but may reflect expansions of consciousness. I respond by examining how the self enables survival yet contributes to suffering, distinguishing expanded states from perspective, and proposing perspective as the hinge that transforms transient ego-dissolution into lasting growth. I differentiate pain from suffering and note how ketamine\u2019s modulation of the default mode and anti-reward networks uniquely fosters equanimity, opening analytic space. Because psychedelics can overwhelm defenses, preparation, and set and setting remain decisive. I propose integration practices that consolidate the observing stance\u2014variously described as observing ego, thirdness, mindful awareness, or Atman. Psychedelic psychoanalysis, I suggest, builds upon rather than abandons analytic commitments, translating oceanic states into enduring capacities for reflection, equanimity, and relatedness. I close with a clinical vignette and proposals for distinguishing restorative union from defensive fusion, sequencing ketamine-assisted analysis, and sustaining perspective.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Burnout is a debilitating syndrome associated with emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a low sense of personal accomplishment. For medical students, studies suggest that burnout related to stress may begin as early as their first year and can be associated with poor academic performance, general distress, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation. PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVE: Previous literature suggests that mindfulness training, breathing exercises, and social support can be protective against the effects of burnout. Our study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a new wellness program consisting mainly of brief, daily, mindfulness-based micro-habit training sessions. METHODS/DESIGN: The study adopted a single-group before-and-after design for a duration of eight weeks. PARTICIPANTS: Twelve medical students consented to participate (7 female); mean age = 26.25 years (SD = 4.4). INTERVENTION: The micro-habit intervention is delivered by a mobile app and is supported by weekly peer-circle meetings. The micro-habits are taught by listening to self-contained 90-second mindfulness exercises, at least once daily, five days per week. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Maslach burnout inventory, a well-established 22-item self-report survey; Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS21), a 21-item version of the DASS42; and Weekly Stress Scale, for which participants reported their stress level in terms of one of the categories (i.e., green, amber, or red) each week. RESULTS: The six participants who completed the post-intervention Maslach inventory exhibited a significant decline in emotional exhaustion (P = .03, 1-tailed) with a large effect size (d = 0.99). The five participants who completed the DASS21 at post-intervention averaged a considerable but non-significant decline in anxiety (d = 0.57). CONCLUSION: Despite the small sample size, it is encouraging that even a brief micro-habit intervention, one suited to busy medical students, can produce a considerable decrease in burnout symptoms, warranting a study with a larger cohort.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Hypertension is a global target for noncommunicable diseases, and meditation-based interventions (MBIs) benefit patients with hypertension (HTN). The primary objective of this scoping review is to map the globally published MBI studies on patients with HTN. The secondary goal is to identify the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in HTN. METHODS: Based on the Arksey and O'Malley protocol of the Joanna Briggs Institute framework for scoping review, 5 electronic databases were searched with search terms related to HTN and meditation. The open-access articles in the English language published between 1985 and 2024 were selected. The selected articles involved MBIs. All the studies were uploaded to the Rayyan software. Two reviewers worked independently and in duplicate to screen the studies first for title and abstract, and then for full text. Data were extracted based on the template for the intervention description and replication checklist. The data were summarized and reported as a narrative summary. RESULTS: In total, 966 studies were identified. After removing 429 duplicates, 537 studies were screened for their titles and abstracts. 467 studies were excluded based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 18 were not retrieved, and 20 were excluded with reasons. Finally, the full texts of 70 studies were read. 32 eligible studies were included in this review. The studies were divided into 3 categories based on meditation and into 7 categories based on outcome. Moreover, no study involving human subjects has analyzed the level of BDNF in HTN patients receiving MBIs. CONCLUSION: MBIs have shown promising results among HTN patients. There is a research gap in studies related to BDNF and meditation among hypertensive patients. The limitation of the review is the inclusion of open-access articles published only in the English language. KEYWORDS: Hypertension, Meditation, Mindfulness, Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor.",

      "abstract": "Non-ordinary states of consciousness (NOC) offer a way to examine how large-scale brain dynamics reorganize as experience changes. We studied a participant able to reliably enter a self-induced NOC state characterized by vivid imagery, altered bodily perception, and a sense of unity. Across 20 fMRI sessions, we measured functional connectivity in four conditions (Baseline, Transition, NOC, and Residual) and compared the results with a matched control group. During the Transition phase, connectivity became more variable, indicating a temporary destabilization of network organization. In the NOC state, inter-network connectivity decreased broadly, with visual cortex showing reduced coupling to auditory, sensorimotor, orbitofrontal, thalamic, and cerebellar regions, and the somatomotor-dorsal network disengaging from auditory and language cortices, paralleling the reported visual phenomena and changes in bodily experience. In contrast, frontoparietal and salience networks showed increased coupling with precuneus/posterior cingulate, multimodal temporal cortex, and cerebellar hubs, in agreement with subjective reports of sustained inward-directed attention and stable absorption. Entropy and complexity analyses revealed systematic shifts that tracked the experiential sequence and returned to baseline in the Residual condition. This single-case study brings together something uncommon: controlled experimentation, voluntary induction of NOC states, and rich phenomenological data. Taken together, these elements offer a strong foundation for neurophenomenological research and illustrate why pairing structured paradigms with lived experience is useful for understanding non-ordinary states of consciousness.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Beneficial effects of mindful eating-based interventions during pregnancy have been reported. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to synthesize the available evidence on the effects of mindfulness-based interventions during pregnancy that incorporate a mindful eating (ME) protocol on the health and well-being of pregnant women, including mental health, body metabolism (weight gain and/or blood glucose levels), eating behavior, and physical activity levels. DATA SOURCES: The search was conducted in the Medline, Web of Science, PsycArticles, Embase, Scopus, Food Science Source, CINAHL, and Google Scholar databases. DATA EXTRACTION: Studies that describe ME-based interventions in pregnant women were identified. Risk of bias was determined using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool, and the level of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. DATA ANALYSIS: Of the 489 articles identified, only 4 non-randomized intervention studies met the inclusion criteria. All selected studies used the \"Mindful Motherhood Training\" protocol and employed validated methods for measuring outcomes. The studies assessed the impact of the intervention on mental health and revealed significant reductions in stress and depressive symptoms, and significant increases in physical activity, among other outcomes. CONCLUSION: Although they showed that there are potentially benefits from ME interventions, particularly in contributing to mental health (reduction in depressive symptoms) and increasing physical activity levels, the included studies were assessed as being exploratory in nature, of low methodological quality, having inconsistent results, and having aspects of serious concern regarding the certainty domain. Improvements in the quality of the ME interventions during pregnancy are necessary. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO registration No. CRD42024496025.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Yoga is reported to have a beneficial impact on mental well-being, thus improving attention. Research efforts have focused on understanding how yoga influences various aspects, such as short-term memory and self-esteem, particularly among adolescents. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the effect of yogic techniques on short-term memory and self-esteem in school students. METHODS: The study conducted at Srinanda High School in Bolpur, West Bengal, investigated the effects of asanas, pranayama, chanting, and meditation on short-term memory and self-esteem among school students aged 12-15 years. With a sample size of 40, comprising 14 males and 26 females, the study included physically and mentally healthy participants who had provided informed consent. The study employed a single-group pre- and post-design, where participants underwent assessments using the Trail Making Test (A & B) to measure short-term memory and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale to assess self-esteem before and after engaging in yogic techniques. RESULTS: Significant improvements were observed in short-term memory among the participants after practicing yogic techniques for one and a half months. The P values for both components of the Trail Making Test (A and B) were less than .001, indicating enhanced memory function. However, a reduction in Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale scores was observed post-intervention. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that Yoga can be effective in enhancing the short-term memory of adolescents. In the future, longitudinal studies and randomized controlled trials should be conducted in this area to generalize the results.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindful eating serves as a therapeutic intervention for recognizing and gradually altering the established daily eating habits and patterns. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to estimate the prevalence of adoption of principles of mindful eating among medical and non-medical university students and to detect the effect of adoption of mindful eating on the Body Mass Index of the studied subjects. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 576 undergraduate students using a structured self-administered questionnaire comprising sociodemographic data, perceived weight and height and Mindful Eating Questionnaire. RESULTS: The majority of the studied students (94.4%) were used to adopt Mindful eating. The percentages of medical and non-medical students were used to adopt Mindful eating were (97.6% and 91.3%, respectively). A statistically significant association was detected between the type of the study (faculty) and adoption of mindful eating (P-value\u2009=\u20090.001). Medical study permits adopting mindful eating by about 73.8% more than non-medical studies. Medical male students showed higher scores for the disinhibition subscale than females (P-value\u2009=\u20090.025) while non-medical female students showed higher scores for the awareness subscale than males (P-value\u2009=\u20090.006). Nearly three fourths of the studied subjects (74.3%) had Body Mass Index\u2009\u2265\u200925. The percentage of medical students (17.4%) having Body Mass Index\u2009\u2265\u200925 was less than the percentage of their non-medical peers (34.0%). The association between the type of the study (faculty) and Body Mass Index categories was statistically significant (P-value\u2009=\u2009<\u20090.001). The higher scores on the Mindful Eating Questionnaire overall and on each of the categories except the awareness score had been associated with lower Body Mass Index. Most of the students adopting Mindful eating (75.4%) had Body Mass Index\u2009<\u200925 as compared to their peers who did not adopt Mindful eating where more than one third of them (43.8%) had Body Mass Index\u2009\u2265\u200925. The association between Mindful eating summary score categories and Body Mass Index categories was statistically significant (P-value\u2009=\u20090.016). A significant negative weak correlation was detected between Mindful eating summary score categories and Body Mass Index categories (P-value\u2009=\u20090.044). CONCLUSION: Academic background reinforces the potential of mindful eating as a viable strategy for promoting healthier eating habits and effective weight management among university students.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psychological distress during pregnancy-including anxiety, depression, and fear of childbirth can adversely affect maternal well-being and obstetric outcomes. Midwifery-led care, which integrates antenatal education and psychosocial support, has been increasingly recognized as an effective approach to enhance maternal mental health and birth experiences. However, evidence from clinical trials remains fragmented and inconsistent. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following the PRISMA 2020 and Cochrane guidelines. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of midwifery-led interventions, including psychoeducation, counselling, mindfulness, continuity of care, and group prenatal care-on maternal psychological and obstetric outcomes were identified through PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, Web of Science, and CINAHL up to January 2024. Pooled effect sizes were calculated via random-effects models (REMLs) with standardized mean differences (SMDs) or risk ratios (RRs) and 95\u202f% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: A total of 18 RCTs involving 7462 women were included. Compared with standard or routine care, midwifery-led interventions significantly reduced maternal anxiety (SMD = -0.51, 95\u202f% CI -0.62 to -0.39), depression (SMD = -0.61, 95\u202f% CI -0.77 to -0.45), and fear of childbirth (SMD = -0.77, 95\u202f% CI -1.06 to -0.49) while enhancing maternal satisfaction and self-efficacy (SMD = 0.46, 95\u202f% CI 0.36-0.57). Regarding obstetric outcomes, pooled analyses indicated lower risks of preterm birth (RR = 0.74, 95\u202f% CI 0.63-0.88) and cesarean section (RR = 0.81, 95\u202f% CI 0.76-0.86), with a modest increase in birthweight (+0.11\u202fkg, 95\u202f% CI -0.09-0.30). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results across intervention formats (in-person, group, or digital), regions, and measurement tools. CONCLUSION: Compared with standard care, midwifery-led psychological and educational interventions significantly improved maternal mental health and obstetric outcomes. The incorporation of structured midwife-led programs into routine antenatal services may enhance childbirth preparation, reduce intervention rates, and promote positive maternal experiences. These findings support midwifery-led care as a safe, effective, and woman-centered clinical model for optimizing perinatal outcomes.",
