      "abstract": "Autobiographical memory deficits are well-documented in aphantasia, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Emerging models suggest that interoception plays a crucial role in mental imagery, a key component of memory retrieval. In this study, we investigate the relationship between self-reported interoception, mental imagery, and autobiographical memory, with a specific focus on aphantasia. First, we examined whether interoceptive awareness and autobiographical memory differ between individuals with core aphantasia (n\u2009=\u200969), hypophantasia (n\u2009=\u2009266) and typical imagers (n\u2009=\u2009133). Our findings reveal that aphantasics report significantly lower autobiographical memory as well as subjective interoceptive awareness across key subscales, including emotional awareness and noticing. Secondly, a mediation analysis reveals that mental imagery mediates the relationship between the emotional awareness subscale of the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) questionnaire and autobiographical memory, suggesting that subjective interoception may contribute to memory recall indirectly through its influence on imagery. These findings provide novel empirical support for the idea that interoception is linked to both mental imagery and memory retrieval. The reduced interoceptive awareness observed in aphantasia may contribute to their known deficits in autobiographical memory, positioning aphantasia as a condition that extends beyond a lack of mental imagery to include altered interoceptive processing.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mental illness stigma remains a major barrier to mental health in many parts of the world, including China, where public stigma is particularly pervasive among university students. The Acceptance and Commitment to Empowerment intervention (ACE), an integration of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Group Empowerment Psychoeducation, was adapted and piloted in a Chinese university context. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the ACE intervention in reducing both explicit and implicit public stigma toward people with mental illness among Chinese university students. METHODS: We conducted a cluster-randomized waitlist-controlled trial at a university in Shandong Province, China, with a total of 111 students participating. Participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a control group. The ACE intervention combined a self-paced online course on mental health literacy with a five-day, in-person experiential training focused on acceptance, mindfulness, values, and empowerment. Explicit stigma was assessed using self-report questionnaires (Attribution Questionnaire-9 and Social Distance Scale), while implicit stigma was measured through a Single-Category Implicit Association Test (SC-IAT). RESULTS: Mixed-measures ANOVA revealed a significant reduction in explicit stigma in the ACE intervention group over time, with no significant change in the control group. SC-IAT scores indicated that participants in the ACE group had significantly lower levels of implicit stigma compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that the ACE intervention can effectively reduce public stigma among Chinese university students. The findings support the cultural adaptability of ACE and offer insights for implementing stigma-reduction programs in China. Recommendations for future research are also discussed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Retrospectively registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2500105456). Date of registration July 3, 2025.",

      "abstract": "Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are recognised as effective psychosocial strategies for managing stress. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published up to August 2025 across the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, EBSCO and Google Scholar following the PRISMA guidelines. Seventeen randomised controlled trials (n\u2009=\u20091,641) met the inclusion criteria. Baseline stress did not differ between MBI and control groups (SMD\u2009=\u20090.15, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-0.07 to 0.36, p\u2009=\u20090.18). Post-intervention, MBIs were associated with significantly lower perceived stress (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.53, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-0.72 to -0.33, p\u2009<\u20090.00001). Within-group analyses indicated substantial reductions among MBI participants (SMD\u2009=\u20090.93, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.62 to 1.23, p\u2009<\u20090.00001), whereas controls showed only marginal changes (SMD\u2009=\u20090.23, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.00 to 0.46, p\u2009=\u20090.05). Subgroup analyses confirmed effectiveness across regions and delivery modalities, with larger effects observed in indirect interventions (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.676, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Meta-regression found no significant moderators, and sensitivity analyses demonstrated robustness with minimal publication bias. Collectively, these results support MBIs as effective and scalable strategies for reducing perceived stress in non-clinical adults, highlighting the need for further evaluation of their effects on physiological stress markers.",

      "abstract": "This qualitative study explored the complex interplay between masculinity, body image, and yoga within the socio-cultural context of South Korea, a society shaped by collectivism, traditional Confucian gender norms, and heightened appearance orientation. Guided by Straussian grounded theory and a constructivist-interpretivist framework, in-depth interviews were conducted with 11 male practitioners that had been practicing yoga for at least one year. The core concept of embodied renegotiation was identified through interpretive analysis of emergent themes constructed from the narratives of the participants, illustrating a process in which respondents redefined and navigated perceptions of body image through their engagement with yoga. The findings of our study revealed the following themes: a) rejection of Western male body image ideals, b) reframing the body through yoga, and c) connection with the inner self. The narratives of the participants indicated a shift from external self-perception towards internalized self-acceptance which fostered body appreciation and enhanced psychological well-being. Our study extends existing literature by highlighting how leisure-based practices that promote mindfulness and interoceptive awareness such as yoga may act as a counter-narrative to hegemonic masculinity by promoting body positivity. Implications underscore the need for culturally sensitive and gender-inclusive interventions that enhance body image and self-perceptions for men, particularly within non-Western cultural settings.",

      "abstract": "Sarcoidosis exemplifies the complexity of modern internal medicine, requiring comprehensive, system-based management. The disease is characterized by non-caseating granulomas and can affect virtually any organ, with pulmonary involvement in over 90 % of patients and extrapulmonary manifestations in up to 70 %. Its heterogeneous spectrum, variable course, and risk of organ damage make early recognition and multidisciplinary collaboration essential. This narrative review outlines the clinical manifestations of sarcoidosis, emphasizing organ-specific and systemic non-organ specific symptoms such as fatigue and small fiber neuropathy, which substantially impair quality of life (QoL). Advances in imaging, including cardiac MRI and 18F-FDG PET/CT, together with biomarkers such as soluble IL-2 receptor, have improved diagnostic accuracy, risk stratification, and monitoring. Yet, histological confirmation is almost invariably needed. Therapeutic strategies continue to evolve from the classical glucocorticoid-centered step-up approach toward more personalized regimens. Steroid-sparing agents such as methotrexate, azathioprine, and leflunomide are widely used, while biologics, particularly anti-TNF agents, and emerging small-molecule inhibitors (e.g., JAK and mTOR inhibitors) offer additional options in refractory disease. New investigational therapies, including efzofitimod, are under evaluation. Beyond pharmacology, sarcoidosis management increasingly relies on multidisciplinary teams, integration of primary and tertiary care, and attention to comorbidities and QoL. Digital health tools, telemedicine, and mindfulness-based interventions show promise in supporting patient-centered care. Artificial intelligence and multi-omics approaches may further enhance diagnostic accuracy, phenotyping, and precision medicine in the near future. In conclusion, sarcoidosis stands as a paradigm of complexity in internal medicine, underscoring the need for holistic care, innovation, and collaboration to improve long-term outcomes.",

Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have emerged as promising adjunctive treatments. However, the evidence base remains heterogeneous. The present systematic review evaluated the current empirical literature on MBIs for GD, focusing on their efficacy, methodological quality, and limitations. METHODS: Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, and PsycINFO were searched for English-language studies published between 2012 and April 2025. The final sample comprised 12 studies: five randomized controlled trials, one controlled pilot study, two repeated-measures studies, one mixed-methods study, and three single-group pretest-posttest studies. A narrative synthesis evaluated MBI impacts. RESULTS: MBIs consistently reduced gambling frequency and cravings while enhancing psychological outcomes. Studies combining mindfulness with cognitive behavioral therapy showed significant declines in problem gambling behavior. Psychological distress and cravings also decreased notably across interventions. The mindfulness components employed varied in focus and application, adding nuance to outcome interpretation. However, it remains unclear to what extent the observed effects can be attributed to mindfulness-specific mechanisms. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: MBIs show promise as a complementary treatment for gambling disorders, although small sample sizes and methodological limitations suggest a need for more robust research.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This evidence base update investigates the empirical support of psychosocial interventions for self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs) in youth, focusing on the period since the prior review. METHOD: Two major scientific databases (PsycInfo and PubMed) were systematically searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published or in press between June 1, 2018 and May 31, 2024. RESULTS: The search yielded 11 RCTs new to this update and 1 new SITB outcome to an RCT included in the prior review. Since the prior review, Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Adolescents (DBT-A) was reclassified as Level 1: Well-established intervention for reducing adolescent suicide attempts, and Family Therapy was reclassified as Level 2: Probably efficacious for reducing youth suicide ideation (SI). Cognitive behavioral therapy-individual\u2009+\u2009family was reclassified as Level 4: Experimental for reducing youth suicide attempts. Four new RCTs examining adjunctive skills or boosters for brief interventions were rated as Level 2: Probably Efficacious for reducing SI (adjunctive mindfulness skills\u2009+\u2009Psychodynamic therapy, adjunctive skills - emotion regulation) or Level 3: Possibly Efficacious for reducing SITBs (adjunctive safety planning interventions). CONCLUSIONS: DBT-A remains the sole well-established intervention for reducing SITBs, with replication by multiple independent research teams. Half the RCTs identified in this review aimed to replicate or extend prior interventions. Several newly identified trials in this review were primarily adjunctive or brief, demonstrating greater efforts to enhance the availability of interventions for SITBs in youth. Further replication of these adjunctive treatments is needed to clarify their effectiveness and potential for widespread implementation.",

      "abstract": "This letter responds to Prieto et al.'s discussion of our article Rethinking epilepsy stigma: the uncanny, the emotional, and the structural. We clarify that our original framework was primarily theoretical, aiming to illuminate the multifaceted mechanisms sustaining internalized epilepsy stigma, including the \"uncanny\" experience of seizures, ambivalent emotional responses, and structural inequities. We highlight how third-generation psychotherapeutic approaches, emphasizing psychological flexibility, mindfulness, and emotional acceptance, complement cognitive-behavioral strategies by enhancing individuals' capacity to relate adaptively to stigma-related distress. We propose that integrating behavioural, emotional, and structural perspectives offers a multidimensional framework to better understand and address internalized epilepsy stigma, guiding interventions that promote psychological well-being, social inclusion, and empowerment for people living with epilepsy.",
