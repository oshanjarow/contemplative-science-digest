      "abstract": "The purpose of the article is to identify and comprehend manifestations of meditativeness in Ukrainian academic music of the second half of the 20th century, tracing its evolution \u2014 from individual compositional styles to its establishment as a cultural phenomenon with its own aesthetic and philosophical foundation. Special attention is given to the influence of meditative elements on the listener\u2019s perceptual experience and the formation of an inner dialogue through musical reflection. The research employs an interdisciplinary methodology, combining musicological analysis with a cultural approach, allowing for the examination of specific works by Ukrainian composers in the context of the listener\u2019s perceptive engagement. Scientific novelty lies in the interpretation of meditativeness not merely as a stylistic feature or artistic device, but as a form of spiritual practice integrated into the academic tradition, shaping a distinct type of musical thinking. For the first time, the role of the listener is emphasised as an active participant in the meditative process, capable of deep reflection. The conclusions affirm that meditative tendencies in Ukrainian academic music of the second half of the 20th century are not accidental stylistic phenomena, but rather profound expressions of a cultural need for silence, introspection, and inner dialogue. These tendencies form a new quality of musical thought that unites aesthetic, philosophical, and existential dimensions. In this context, music becomes a space for spiritual practice, where the listener does not merely perceive the sonic fabric but engages in dialogue with their own inner world. Such experience fosters new models of perception, in which music acts as a mediator between the external and the internal, between aesthetic experience and personal transformation. Meditativeness in music opens up prospects for further research, particularly in the fields of perceptual aesthetics, music psychology, and the philosophy of art, where the listener is viewed as an active participant in the aesthetic process, capable of profound reflection and spiritual growth.",

      "abstract": "This article examines the phenomenon of forest monks\u2019 meditative practices in Thai Buddhism based on a comprehensive historical, philosophical, phenomenological, and sociocultural analysis. Particular attention is paid to the role of key teachers in the dissemination of this phenomenon (Ajahn Sao, Ajahn Mun, Ajahn Chah, and others), meditation methods (samatha, vipassana, thudong), and the influence of the natural environment on the development of ascetic discipline. The contemporary social and cultural significance of forest monks is analyzed, including their contributions to environmental conservation, as well as their interaction with governmental and community institutions. The article argues that the combination of strict asceticism, adherence to the Vinaya, and flexible responses to urban challenges enables the forest tradition to remain relevant in the 21st century. Forest monasticism is shown to be a holistic cultural complex \u2013 a system of symbols, norms, and bodily practices that ensure the reproduction of Thai society\u2019s cultural identity and the production of cultural meanings in the context of global transformations. The relevance of approaches from cultural ecology, symbolic anthropology, and ritual theory to the analysis of forest tradition is emphasized.",

      "abstract": "Hydrogel biomaterials offer great promise for three-dimensional cell culture and therapeutic delivery. Despite many successes, challenges persist in that gels formed from natural proteins are only marginally tunable whereas those derived from synthetic polymers lack intrinsic bioinstructivity. Toward the creation of biomaterials with both excellent biocompatibility and customizability, recombinant protein\u2013based hydrogels have emerged as molecularly defined and user-programmable platforms that mimic the proteinaceous nature of the extracellular matrix. Here, we introduce PhoCoil, a dynamically tunable recombinant hydrogel formed from a single protein component with unique multistimuli responsiveness. Physical cross-linking through coiled-coil interactions promotes rapid shear-thinning and self-healing behavior, rendering the gel injectable, whereas an included photodegradable motif affords on-demand network dissolution via visible light. PhoCoil gel photodegradation can be spatiotemporally and lithographically controlled in a dose-dependent manner, through complex tissue, and without harm to encapsulated cells. We anticipate that PhoCoil will further enable applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",

      "abstract": "Degeneration of articular cartilage is the key underlying cause of most joint\u2010related diseases and yet little is known about its regeneration. Here, we report that skeletal interoception induces anabolic synthesis of superficial membrane by tuning down sympathetic norepinephrine (NE). Specifically, the superficial membrane is consumed during animal activity and anabolically renewed by the underneath chondrocytes in the superficial zone (SFZ). Notably, by stereotactic knockdown of sympathetic NE synthesis in the paraventricular nucleus, articular cartilage thickness increases. Moreover, deletion of the gene encoding the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptor, EP4, in sensory nerves for ascending interoceptive pathway induces damage of superficial membrane and articular cartilage degeneration. In contrast, increase of interoceptive signaling by elevation of local PGE2 reduces sympathetic outflow to promote the anabolic renewal of superficial membrane. Importantly, inducible knockout of the \u03b2\u20102\u2010adrenergic\u2010receptor (Adrb2) in the SFZ chondrocytes damages superficial membrane and treadmill running aggravates the damage. Mechanistically, NE\u2010mediated activation of Adrb2 induces internalization of Adrb2 and TGF\u2010\u03b2 type II receptor as a complex, thereby regulating TGF\u2010\u03b2 activity for articular cartilage homeostasis regeneration. Together, physical activity induces an anabolic renewal of the superficial membrane by downregulation hypothalamic NE for optimized thickness and integrity of articular cartilage.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stress impacts the quality of life for stroke survivors (SS) and support persons (SPs) during recovery, negatively affecting both individuals in the stroke dyad (SD). While mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) can improve well-being, their complexity and time demands are significant barriers for implementation in the stroke community. Tailoring MBI to the needs of SS and SP (modified-MBI) shows promise in improving stress and quality of life for both members of the SD throughout long-term recovery. METHODS: The A Mindful Approach to Managing Stress (A-MAMS) intervention enrolled 58 participants to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an 8-week virtual asynchronous m-MBI. Enrollment, retention, lesson, and homework completion rates were measured. End-of-study feedback survey (EOS) data was also collected. RESULTS: The A-MAMS intervention demonstrated high feasibility (enrollment rate=96.7%; attendance rate=98.3%) and acceptability (lesson and homework completion rates=97.8% and 98.8%, retention rate=89.7%). A total of 52 participants (30 SS and 22 SP; 15 SD members) completed all course components and EOS. The EOS feedback indicated 96.2% found the intervention helpful for stress management and would recommend it. No significant dyadic effect was identified. CONCLUSION: This remotely delivered m-MBI was feasible and acceptable for adult SS and SP. These findings support the utility of tailored, accessible mindfulness interventions for the SD, laying a foundation for future research on their implementation and impact.",

      "abstract": "Active inference describes motor action as a prediction-driven inferential process, whereby ascending proprioceptive prediction errors are attenuated to allow the fulfillment of expected movement. Meditative practices typically involve a heightened attention to bodily sensations, begging the question of whether this could partially offset the normal proprioceptive suppression during a simple motor act. In this study, 42 experienced meditators completed a tactile force-matching task, designed to measure somatosensory attenuation. The active group ([Formula: see text]) performed the task before (T1), during (T2), and three weeks after (T3) an intensive 10-day mindfulness meditation retreat, while a control waiting list group ([Formula: see text]) was also measured three times, but before participating in the retreat. Analysis of T1 data confirmed the presence of a general somatosensory attenuation effect across groups, which correlated negatively with pre-retreat trait measures of mindfulness, as predicted by our hypothesis. Contrary to our expectations, however, longitudinal analyses did not reveal a global reduction in somatosensory attenuation as an effect of intensive meditation practice. We observed instead a subtler regression-to-the-mean effect at T1, which increased with task repetition in control participants (T1>T2>T3), a training-related phenomenon not previously reported for the force-matching task. Interestingly, this habituation behavior was not shown by the active participants, who maintained the level of regression-to-the-mean observed at baseline at T2, suggesting that the formation of prior expectations about the presented force intensity may be affected by the retreat. We discuss how multiple, opposite effects of meditation on proprioceptive active inference mechanisms, and/or an alteration of prior formation and their influence, may explain these findings.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is a debilitating condition in older adults that can lead to mobility impairments, disability, and premature death. While older adults with chronic pain demonstrate gait impairments compared to healthy older adults, how gait patterns change following cognitive or psychological tasks remain unclear. RESEARCH QUESTION: How do gait patterns change from usual walking to dual-task walking, following an acute rumination task, and following an acute mindfulness task in older adults with chronic pain? Secondarily, what is the relationship between pain, number of pain medications, and gait? METHODS: In this ancillary study, 21 participants walked over a four-meter instrumented walkway at their usual speed, while performing a cognitive task, following an acute mindfulness task, and following an acute rumination task. Participants also reported their pain interference and number of pain medications. Paired t-tests were used to determine differences in spatiotemporal gait measures from usual walking to dual-task, mindfulness, and rumination. Spearman's correlations determined the relationship between pain interference, medications, and gait measures. RESULTS: Compared to usual walking, older adults walked slower, with shorter steps, and greater variability during dual-task walking. Following acute mindfulness, older adults walked with moderately longer steps, and following acute rumination, there were no changes in gait. Increased pain intensity was associated with greater gait variability and longer step time, and more pain medications were associated with slower gait speed. SIGNIFICANCE: Nonpharmacological interventions, such as dual-task training or longer, repeated bouts of mindfulness training, should be explored as interventions to improve gait and mobility in older adults with chronic pain.",
