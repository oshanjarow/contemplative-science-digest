      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Testicular cancer (TC) disproportionately affects younger men and carries unique psychosocial and physiological consequences that extend well beyond treatment. Despite favorable survival rates, TC survivors frequently report diminished health-related quality of life (HRQoL). These burdens are often compounded by masculinity-related identity disruptions, fear of recurrence, sexual dysfunction, and a lack of tailored psychosocial support. Existing interventions remain limited, with most programs focused on physical rehabilitation or early detection. Few address the multidimensional stressors that shape the TC survivorship experience. AIMS: This narrative review examines the literature on HRQoL among TC survivors and evaluates the potential of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) as a viable therapeutic strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature search identified artivles that were produced in the past two decades+ that investigated the relationship between MBIs and TC survivor HRQoL. DISCUSSION: Evidence from broader cancer populations demonstrates that MBIs, such as meditation, breathing exercises, and mindfulness-based psychoeducation, can reduce psychological distress and promote emotional regulation. Programs like MindCAN have shown promise in improving self-awareness, affect, and coping. Importantly, MBIs offer a low-cost, flexible, and sustainable approach that aligns with the autonomy often valued by men navigating survivorship. CONCLUSION: To date, no fully developed mindfulness trials have been developed specifically for TC survivors. Given the early age of diagnosis and long survivorship trajectories, as well as the unique psychological and physiological health outcomes associated with TC, MBIs may be especially well-suited to this population. This review calls for a renewed focus on implementing mindfulness-based strategies designed for the lived realities of TC survivors. Doing so may meaningfully enhance post-treatment outcomes, reduce disparities in male mental health care, and promote holistic wellness in one of the most underserved cancer survivor populations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The transition from dental student to practicing dentist is often accompanied by high level of stress and risk of burnout. This shift from academic to professional roles can overwhelm students and compromise their well-being. Addressing burnout early is essential to maintain academic performance, resilience, and quality patient care. Mindfulness interventions have shown increasing empirical support in reducing stress and burnout. This mixed-methods study evaluated the effectiveness of mindfulness-based life skill-building sessions in alleviating burnout among final-year dental students at Baqai Dental College, Karachi, Pakistan. METHOD: A sequential mixed-method study was conducted at Baqai Dental College in Karachi, Pakistan, involving sixty-nine final-year dental students. The intervention comprised two mindfulness sessions. Participants completed pre- and post-intervention questionnaires that included demographic information and the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory-Student Survey (CBI-SS), a validated 25-item tool assessing burnout across four domains: personal, study-related, colleague-related, and teacher-related. Post-intervention questionnaires were completed immediately after the sessions. Qualitative data were obtained through focus group discussions with stakeholders to explore perceptions of burnout and assess the relevance and feasibility of mindfulness sessions. Quantitative data were analyzed using paired t-tests, while qualitative data were examined through content analysis and triangulated with literature and documentation. RESULT: Diverse emotions and experiences were revealed through qualitative analysis, underscoring the substantial influence of exhaustion on personal, academic, and professional domains. Furthermore, the mean exhaustion scores were significantly different between the pre- and post-intervention periods, with a p-value of 0.001. Students conveyed satisfaction and a desire for more meaningful sessions that bolster life-building skills. CONCLUSION: The study findings demonstrate a decrease in burnout rates following the intervention, indicating the necessity for interventions to mitigate academic stress. Qualitative findings underscore the significance of a student support centre and self-care initiatives.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Classic serotonergic psychedelics such as LSD and psilocybin show promising antidepressant effects in controlled trials, but real-world data from routine clinical care remain limited. METHODS: This study retrospectively analysed routine data from adults with treatment-resistant depressive and/or anxiety disorders who received a first standardized Psychedelic-assisted Psychotherapy (PAP) cycle with 100 \u00b5g LSD or 25 mg psilocybin at a Swiss university hospital (May 2024-October 2025). Self-reported depression (BDI) and trait anxiety (STAI-T) were assessed at screening, one month before treatment, and 1-3 months post-treatment. In a subset of participants, cognitive emotion regulation (CERQ) was assessed pre- and post-treatment. Subjective drug effects and adverse events were recorded on the treatment day. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 115 patients (56.5 % female; Mean age = 47.5 years). Depressive and anxiety symptoms significantly decreased over time (BDI: F(2178) = 63.50, p < 0.001, partial \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.42; STAI-T: F(1.74,145.9) = 16.97, p < 0.001, partial \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.17), with no main effect of substance. CERQ analyses indicated reduced self-blame, rumination and catastrophizing, and increased positive refocusing and reappraisal. Perceived intensity followed distinct temporal profiles for LSD and psilocybin, but comparable subjective drug effects and clinical outcomes. Adverse events were mostly mild and transient, with no serious complications or treatment discontinuations. CONCLUSIONS: In this compassionate-use real-world cohort, a first fully-active dose PAP session with LSD or psilocybin was well tolerated and associated with significant improvements in depressive and anxiety symptoms. These findings support the feasibility and effectiveness of PAP in specialised routine care.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gatekeeper training programs (GTPs) are a key component of contemporary suicide prevention strategies, equipping community members and non-mental health professionals with the skills to identify, engage with, and refer individuals at risk of suicide. Increasingly, these programs are delivered via the web, offering a compelling alternative to in-person training through greater scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. However, little consensus exists regarding the design, modes of delivery, and implementation strategies of web-based GTPs. Further, there is a limited understanding of which components affect their usability and engagement. OBJECTIVE: This systematic narrative review aims to identify the key components-including facilitators and barriers-of web-based GTPs. METHODS: We systematically searched web-based databases (CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) to identify peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2025 that involved web-based GTPs. After screening, 59 studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed using content analysis to identify key components and barriers affecting the delivery and receipt of web-based GTPs. RESULTS: Results were organized under 3 categories: design, content, and pedagogy. Key design considerations emphasized accessibility for diverse learning styles and digital literacy levels, customizability for different user groups, privacy protection, and the long-term sustainability of training content and delivery platforms. Core training content covered four domains: (1) suicide-related knowledge (eg, prevalence, myths, and at-risk groups), (2) gatekeeping skills (eg, understanding risk factors, recognizing warning signs, problem-solving and safety planning), (3) resource awareness (eg, available local resources and referral procedures), and (4) general mental health education (eg, mental fitness, mindfulness, and self-care strategies for gatekeepers). In terms of pedagogy, the reviewed studies used a wide range of strategies that comprised interactive learning activities (eg, simulation, practice exercises), periodic knowledge checks (eg, quizzes), and reinforcement mechanisms (eg, booster sessions). Additionally, fostering a sense of community (eg, online support spaces or discussion forums) and promoting trainees' autonomy (eg, self-paced training) were highlighted as key components of training delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Web-based GTPs represent a promising avenue for expanding access to suicide prevention training. Their effectiveness may be strengthened through the integration of frameworks tailored to web-based learning environments, as well as interactive and user-centered design elements that support learning and retention. Future research should examine the acceptability, feasibility, and sustainability of these programs, while also refining their adaptation for diverse populations. In this regard, co-design approaches could facilitate the tailoring of such programs to the needs and specificities of their target populations. Overall, enhancing the design and delivery of web-based GTPs may ultimately improve their contribution to suicide prevention efforts.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Emergency service workers (ESWs) are routinely exposed to highly stressful and potentially traumatic events leading to high rates of psychological distress. Early intervention is vital to prevent chronic impairment and/or psychiatric disorders, with digital health innovations (e.g., smartphone apps) offering a potential means of scaling such intervention while overcoming barriers to help-seeking in this population. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of an app designed to reduce psychological distress and related outcomes in ESWs. METHODS: We conducted a randomised controlled trial with ESWs experiencing psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale; K10) score >15. Participants were assigned to the intervention group, a full version of the Build Back Better app (including mindfulness, behavioural activation, trauma-focused cognitive therapy skills, activity and mood monitoring, and healthy coping strategies) or a mood/activity tracking-only version of the same app. Assessment occurred via online self-report questionnaires at baseline (T0) and at 1- and 3-month post-baseline (T1, T2) timepoints. The primary outcome was the K10 score at T2. Linear mixed model analyses were conducted based on the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: N\u2009=\u2009880 ESWs were randomized to the full (n\u2009=\u2009440) or tracking-only (n\u2009=\u2009440) condition. There was no Time x Condition effect for K10 scores, with both conditions showing similar improvements from baseline to 1-month (all ps\u2009<\u2009.001), and 3-month follow-up (all ps\u2009<\u2009.001). Exploratory analyses of moderators (engagement; baseline severity) found generally no significant differences in K10 score decreases across different levels of engagement in the full-app condition, however, app use was markedly low overall. At higher baseline psychological distress levels, there was a significant decrease in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms from baseline to 1-month for the full-app group but not the tracking-only group (p\u2009=\u2009.002, d\u2009=\u2009-1.43). CONCLUSION: Despite consistent improvement across both app conditions, the minimal between group differences found here highlight the difficulties in developing effective, scalable resources for ESWs and the limitations of unguided digital programs more broadly.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This study uses a phenomenological approach to explore how university students perceive and experience \"brain rot,\" a digital-age phenomenon marked by cognitive decline, attention deficits, and emotional desensitization from prolonged exposure to low-quality digital content. RECENT FINDINGS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 university students selected through maximum variation sampling, and data were analyzed using Moustakas' phenomenological method. Findings showed that students associated brain rot with reduced productivity, poor concentration, and impaired decision-making. They reported that low-quality digital content harmed academic performance, caused social isolation, and evoked inadequacy, while coping through self-regulation strategies such as exercise, digital detox, and mindfulness. Ultimately, this study provides the first qualitative evidence of how university students experience brain rot as a result of exposure to low-quality digital content and offers a unique and in-depth conceptual framework regarding its impact on individual and academic life in the digital era.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Intestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and colorectal cancer (CRC) are rising in prevalence worldwide. Despite medical advances, many patients experience persistent symptoms and impaired quality of life (QoL), highlighting the need for integrative, non-pharmacological approaches. AREAS COVERED: This review explores the physiological and clinical impact of yoga therapy in intestinal disorders, examining its effects on neural, intestinal, and microbial pathways. A structured literature search was conducted in PubMed for studies published from database inception to August 2025, to identify relevant clinical trials and meta-analyses across IBS, IBD, and CRC. Evidence suggests yoga improves symptom control, stress resilience, QoL, and may exert anti-inflammatory and neuromodulatory effects. EXPERT OPINION: Yoga therapy presents a low-risk, potentially cost-effective adjunct to conventional care, with applicability across diverse gastrointestinal conditions. Future integration into clinical practice will depend on overcoming barriers such as protocol variability, lack of clinician awareness, and limited reimbursement. Advancements in biomarker research, digital therapeutics, and personalized treatment models will shape the field. In the next decades, yoga therapy may become a standard, personalized component of integrative care in gastroenterology.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This systematic review aims to evaluate the efficacy of single-session interventions of tinnitus educational counseling (SSI-TEDs) in the management of tinnitus. METHOD: A systematic literature search was conducted and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Five studies met the inclusion criteria: three were two-arm randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and two employed a pretest-posttest design. Two studies compared SSI-TED with other interventions-neuro-music therapy ( RESULTS: Across five studies, a total of 307 participants received SSI-TED, while 190 were given alternative interventions. At 1-3 months follow-up, one RCT demonstrated a small-to-medium effect of SSI-TED on reducing tinnitus severity and distress. Pretest-posttest studies reported large effects of SSI-TED on these outcomes. Improvements were also observed in negative emotions, frustration, rumination, and social life. The long-term effect of SSI-TED was noted in one study. No significant effects were found for anxiety or depression. CONCLUSIONS: SSI-TED appears to be a promising intervention for reducing tinnitus-related distress and improving emotional well-being in the short term. The evidence suggests moderate benefits in control conditions and larger effects when evaluated in uncontrolled settings. However, its impact on comorbid anxiety and depression remains unclear. Further high-quality studies with long-term follow-up are needed to establish the sustained efficacy, effectiveness, and broader psychological benefits of SSI-TED.
