      "abstract": "Mindfulness meditation has been suggested to protect mental health and enhance cognitive functions. However, the effectiveness of mindfulness breathing meditation for the general population in Malaysia has not been well documented. This study investigated the effects of mindfulness breathing meditation on perceived stress levels and cognitive functions (i.e., visual attention, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility) using heart rate variability (HRV) and eye-tracking methods. Fifty Malaysian adults aged between 18 and 34 years participated in this study. Participants were randomly allocated to either mindfulness breathing meditation or active control (music therapy) groups. Participants underwent a four-week intervention consisting of 30 min of online classes once a week and 10 min of daily meditation self-practice or music listening. The results showed significant improvement in cognitive flexibility and reduction in perceived stress levels after the intervention in the mindfulness breathing meditation group compared to the active control group. Participants in the mindfulness breathing meditation group self-reported this intervention as highly acceptable and effective in promoting stress reduction, emotional regulation, and attentional control. However, no significant improvement was found in attention, inhibitory control, and HRV after the intervention, suggesting that the mindfulness breathing meditation had no effect on these variables. While short-term engagement with mindfulness breathing meditation practice is achievable, the three-month follow-up using the Mindfulness Adherence Questionnaire showed that sustaining long-term adherence remains a challenge.

      "abstract": "Introduction It is common for college students to suffer from mobile phone addiction, which can seriously affect their physical and mental health. The current study looked at the impact of a brief online mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on mobile phone addiction to address this problem. The mechanisms behind the influence of trait mindfulness (TM) on this process were also investigated in the current study. Methods Subjects were split into two groups for a randomized controlled trial: an experimental group and a control group. During brief online MBI, online assessments of mobile social networking addiction (MSNA), mobile game addiction (MGA), mobile information acquisition addiction (MIAA), and mobile short-form video addiction (MSVA) as well as TM were completed. The present study examined the effectiveness of the brief online MBI with a two-factor repeated measures ANOVA and explored the effects of TM on the four types of mobile phone addiction with hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) after a brief online MBI. Results Results revealed that the experimental group receiving brief online MBI showed a significant decrease in MSNA, MGA, MIAA, and MSVA at the post-test level compared to the pre-test. TM negatively predicted MSNA, MGA, MIAA, and MSVA. Discussion The present study found that the brief online mindfulness-based intervention can effectively reduce four types of mobile phone addiction. In addition, the present study revealed that as the levels of TM increased, all four types of mobile phone addiction decreased.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic non-specific low back pain (CNLBP) is a multifactorial disease involving physical dysfunction and psychological distress. Acupuncture and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) are two non-pharmacological therapies recommended by guidelines, which have been proven effective in improving the clinical symptoms of CNLBP. However, the efficacy of their combined use has yet to be explored. This study aims to explore whether the combination of acupuncture and MBSR would have different synergistic effects in patients with CNLBP compared with acupuncture or MBSR alone. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol describes a randomised controlled trial with a 2\u00d72 factorial design involving 120 CNLBP patients. Participants will be randomly allocated to four groups: (1) acupuncture, (2) MBSR, (3) acupuncture combined with MBSR, and (4) health education. The intervention period is 6 weeks. The outcome measurements will include the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Tactile Acuity Test, Short-form of McGill Pain Questionnairethe(SF-MPQ); Roland-Morris Functional Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), Oswestry Disability Index(ODI), the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21), the Regulatory Self-Efficacy Scale (RESE), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS);Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire(PSQ); Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index(PSQI). All evaluations will be conducted at the baseline stage as well as 6 weeks and 4 months after the implementation of the intervention measures. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Rehabilitation Hospital of the Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (2024KY-041-04). The results of the study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and at scientific conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ITMCTR2025000764.",

METHOD: A total of forty-seven male participants (mean age: 15.49\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.51 years; mean weight: 61.79\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.19\u202fkg; mean height: 172.53\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.8\u202fcm) were recruited and randomly assigned to one of three groups: a mindfulness group (MG; n\u202f=\u202f15), a physical activity group (PAG; n\u202f=\u202f16), and a control group (CG; n\u202f=\u202f16). The intervention consisted of 16 sessions, lasting 30\u202fmin for the MG and 45\u202fmin for the PAG, while the CG received no intervention. Motor skills were assessed at baseline (T0) and after the 8-week intervention (T1) using the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, Second Edition Short Form (BOT-2 SF). RESULTS: Following the intervention, the MG showed significant improvements across (1) fine motor precision (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), (2) fine motor integration (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), (3) manual dexterity (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), (4) bilateral coordination (p\u202f=\u202f0.002), (5) balance (p\u202f=\u202f0.001), (6) running speed and agility (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), (7) upper-limb coordination (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and (8) strength (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness practice is an effective, accessible, and low-cost method to improve motor performance in adolescents with IDD, and its integration into school and therapeutic settings supports their physical development and inclusion.",

      "abstract": "Difficulties engaging in emotion regulation strategies, such as cognitive reappraisal, may contribute to heightened pain severity, functional interference and poorer treatment response among adults with chronic low back pain (CLBP) receiving long-term opioid therapy (LTOT). This study used high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) as a physiological index of negative emotion regulation capacity to examine its influence on psychological treatment outcomes in opioid-treated CLBP. Participants (N = 68) were adults with opioid-treated CLBP enrolled in the Salt Lake City site of a multisite randomized clinical trial comparing mindfulness-based therapy (MBT) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) adjunctive to usual care. At baseline, participants completed an emotion regulation task involving passive viewing and cognitive reappraisal of negative affective stimuli while HF-HRV was recorded. They also completed the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) to assess pain severity and functional interference. Participants were then randomized to 8 weeks of MBT (n = 41) or CBT (n = 27) and completed BPI assessments at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-ups. Linear mixed-effects models revealed that lower baseline reappraisal capacity, as indicated by blunted phasic HF-HRV during the emotional regulation task, significantly predicted higher pain severity and interference following treatment with MBT or CBT through 12-month follow-up. Findings suggest that attenuated ability to regulate autonomic responses during reappraisal of negative emotional stimuli may contribute to more refractory pain outcomes as long as a year later among individuals engaged in evidence-based psychological treatments. Enhancing emotion regulation strategies, like cognitive reappraisal, may strengthen autonomic functioning and improve pain-related outcomes. PERSPECTIVE: This study found that lower baseline cognitive reappraisal efficacy, indexed by blunted HF-HRV during an emotion regulation task, predicted worse response to psychological treatment for adults with opioid-treated CLBP. These findings point to the potential importance of cognitive reappraisal as a therapeutic target in chronic pain interventions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness practice has shown therapeutic benefits in symptom reduction and improved quality of life for adults with pulmonary hypertension (PH) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Some studies testing mindfulness-based interventions often include patients' perspectives about their engagement and acceptability of the tested intervention. Yet, a knowledge gap remains about those who have not participated in mindfulness clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to explore the experiential insights of community-dwelling adults with PH and COPD regarding learning and practicing mindfulness. They were asked to reflect on their understanding of mindfulness, how they acquired the knowledge, and how they practice it, as well as its relationship to disease management. METHODS: Twenty adults (n = 10 PH and n = 10 COPD) provided their perspectives via one-on-one focused interviews after participating in a parent survey study. A qualitative thematic analysis of 20 transcripts was conducted to summarize the main themes relevant to their perspectives. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis revealed six main contextual themes related to mindfulness and disease management: (1) acceptability and accessibility, (2) benefits of mindfulness, (3) barriers to engagement, (4) understanding of mindfulness, (5) symptom management, and (6) introduction and promotion of mindfulness. CONCLUSION: Understanding non-research participants' mindfulness knowledge and practice through their experiences provides considerations for future research. Perspectives from these individuals, who were not self-selected for the research, are valuable because they inform the clinical implementation of creating appropriate mindfulness-based interventions that are likely to be successful in the real world.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: For adolescents living with higher body weight, changing lifestyle behaviours can be met with challenges due to psychosocial factors, such as mental health and emotional challenges. Few behavioural interventions have included skill development to manage these mental health and emotional challenges. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The feasibility of a dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT)-enhanced lifestyle intervention will be evaluated through a pilot randomised controlled trial. We will recruit 90 adolescents aged 14-17 years with a body mass index Z-score >1.4\u2009and mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms to participate with a caregiver in the trial. Adolescents will be randomised 2:2:1 to one of the three study arms: (A) behavioural lifestyle intervention with DBT skills training, (B) behavioural lifestyle intervention alone (ie, without DBT skills training) or (C) control. The interventions will include two sessions weekly for 16 weeks that include (1) one modified DBT skills training with two facilitators, supervised by a clinical psychologist, combined with one behavioural lifestyle session delivered by a dietitian and/or a kinesiologist and (2) two behavioural lifestyle sessions alone. DBT skills training will consist of teaching mindfulness, emotion regulation, distress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness and walking the middle path modules. Behavioural sessions will be guided by evidence-based practices for goal setting, dietary counselling, improving sleep, reducing screen time and structured physical activity. The main outcomes are enrolment rates, adherence to the intervention and retention rates for follow-up measurements. The secondary outcome will be changes in the quality of life (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory) and daily physical activity levels between baseline and immediately post-intervention. Adolescents will participate in a focus group incorporating photo elicitation to explore satisfaction, acceptability and perceived benefits of the study arms. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has received ethical approval from the University of Manitoba's Biomedical Research Ethics Committee (HS24295-H2020:427), Hamilton Health Sciences & McMaster University (HiREB 18159) and The Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board (CHREB), University of Calgary (REB24-1084). Results will be disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals and be relevant to researchers and clinicians involved in paediatrics and paediatric weight management.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Functional neurological disorder (FND) is common and associated with substantial disability, yet evidence-based treatment options remain limited. Because maladaptive attentional processes are central to FND pathophysiology, mindfulness-based interventions may be beneficial. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) has strong empirical support across physical and mental health conditions, but evidence in FND is sparse. OBJECTIVES: To assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical outcomes of MBSR for patients with FND. METHODS: In this monocentric, single-arm feasibility study, German-speaking adults with confirmed FND were recruited from a specialized outpatient clinic. Participants completed an 8-week standardized MBSR program across three course cycles (two in-person, one online). Primary outcomes included recruitment, retention, attendance, and self-reported home practice; acceptability was assessed via recommendation likelihood. Secondary outcomes included health-related quality of life (WHODAS 2.0), functional impairment (WSAS), depressive (PHQ-9) and anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), and FND symptom burden (FNSQ). Assessments occurred at baseline, post-intervention, and three-month follow-up. RESULTS: Of 57 eligible patients, 24 enrolled (42%); 22 completed the course (92%). Recommendation likelihood was high. Statistically significant pre-post improvements were observed in WHODAS 2.0 (d\u00a0=\u00a0-0.56) and WSAS (d\u00a0=\u00a0-0.67), with comparable values at three-month follow-up. Post-intervention PHQ-9 scores improved (d\u00a0=\u00a0-0.75), FNSQ symptom count decreased (d\u00a0=\u00a0-0.68), whereas GAD-7 changes were nonsignificant. Online delivery demonstrated particularly strong adherence without dropouts. CONCLUSIONS: MBSR for FND is feasible and well-accepted. A randomized controlled trial is warranted to determine efficacy. Future research could serve as a model for transforming patient-centered care in the digital era. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00034806).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Foreign language learning often triggers significant anxiety, particularly in speaking tasks, which can hinder students' performance and engagement. According to recent research, mindfulness stands as a promising approach to alleviate such anxiety and foster a more supportive language learning environment. AIMS: This study explores the impact of a mindfulness-based intervention program for foreign language classes (MBI-FLC) on foreign language speaking anxiety (FLSA) and the reflections of the participants about the implemented program. SAMPLE: Following the earthquake-related transition to online instruction, 15 students in a one-year intensive English program participated in the eight-week MBI-FLC program including sessions between 45 and 60\u00a0min. METHOD: A mixed-methods approach was utilized, combining quantitative measures through pre-, post-, and 6-month delayed post-intervention questionnaire/scale and qualitative insights from semi-structured interviews, learner journals, and reflection reports during/after the relevant sessions. RESULTS: Quantitative analysis revealed descriptive decreases in FLSA immediately after the intervention, though gains diminished at follow-up, highlighting the need for continued practice. Some mindfulness facets correlated negatively with FLSA, while the \"relativity of thoughts\" facet unexpectedly showed a positive relationship. Moreover, the qualitative data collected throughout the study revealed three convergent themes: increased awareness, greater acceptance, and improved attentional control, aligning with the short-term reductions in anxiety. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight the potential of mindfulness to improve emotional well-being and speaking confidence in EFL contexts, offering practical implications for integrating mindfulness into language pedagogy.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Suicide is a leading cause of premature death, with risk peaking around psychiatric hospitalization. Emotion dysregulation (ED) is recognized as a key factor contributing to suicidal ideation and behavior across psychiatric diagnoses. The efficacy of interventions that target ED for suicidality reduction remains unclear, so we aimed to assess these interventions in psychiatric inpatients. METHODS: We conducted a PRISMA-compliant, PROSPERO-registered (CRD420251140949) systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and non-randomized trials evaluating interventions targeting emotion regulation (ER) for psychiatric inpatients with suicidal ideation and/or behavior. Searches covered PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO to September 18, 2025. Standardized mean differences (Hedges' g) were pooled under random-effects models and heterogeneity was assessed (Q, I RESULTS: Twelve studies met inclusion (n\u202f=\u202f1708), spanning dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), mindfulness-based interventions, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), and other ER-related protocols. Across modalities, feasibility and acceptability were high and interventions consistently improved suicide-related outcomes in transdiagnostic adolescents and adult populations. Suicide attempts and ideation met outcome criteria for exploratory meta-analyses, and, for both, ER-targeted interventions outperformed usual care, despite heterogeneity and small samples. Exploratory meta-regressions were non-significant; funnel plots did not suggest marked publication bias, though power was limited. CONCLUSIONS: ER-targeted interventions delivered during psychiatric hospitalization are feasible and show promising benefits on suicide-related outcomes. Given heterogeneity and limited sample sizes, larger, well-powered randomized trials using standardized suicidality endpoints are needed to establish efficacy, refine inpatient protocols, and inform acute care pathways.",
