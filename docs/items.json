      "abstract": "This study bridges neuroscience and artificial intelligence by developing advanced models to predict cognitive states\u2014specifically attention and meditation\u2014using raw EEG data collected from low-cost commercial devices such as NeuroSky and Brainlink. Leveraging the temporal capabilities of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRUs), the study evaluates their effectiveness in predicting future cognitive states. These predictions have applications in real-time brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) systems, enhancing responsiveness and adaptability in dynamic environments like robotic control. The proposed LSTM model demonstrated superior predictive accuracy for meditation states, achieving a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 10.90, while the GRU model excelled in predicting attention states, with an RMSE of 11.79. Both models outperformed the results provided by the proprietary eSense algorithm, reinforcing the potential of raw EEG data in cognitive-state analysis. Notably, inference times were optimized to under 50 milliseconds, making the models suitable for real-time applications. These findings underline the feasibility of using raw EEG signals from affordable devices for robust real-time prediction, offering a significant step forward in applied neuroscience. This research lays the groundwork for further exploration of RNN architectures in BCI applications, enabling safer, more intuitive, and personalized interactions in assistive technologies and beyond.",

      "abstract": "Estimates suggest that meditation use is comparable to mental-health-service access in the United States. Understanding meditation-related adverse effects (AEs) is therefore critical. We aimed to (a) estimate the incidence of meditation-related unusual experiences and AEs using different methods and (b) identify sociodemographic and health-related characteristics predicting their incidence. We conducted a cross-sectional, population-based survey of 886 U.S. adults (approximately representing population age, gender, and race/ethnicity) stratified by lifetime meditation experience and type. Of the participants, 96.6% reported an unusual experience, 58.4% reported an AE (Inventory of Meditation Experiences), 78.3% endorsed one or more items on the Meditation-Related Adverse Effects Scale, 31.4% endorsed experiencing a challenging/difficult/distressing experience, and 9.1% reported functional impairment because of AEs. In a robust multiple regression, psychological distress, psychoticism, unusual beliefs, and meditation-retreat participation were positively associated with unusual experiences and AEs. It is essential that (a) potential meditators are informed about possible experiences, (b) providers consider risk factors, and (c) AEs are routinely and actively monitored.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Aims and objective This study aims to evaluate the effect of meditation-based mind-body interventions (MBIs) (Mindfulness, Tai Chi, Yoga, and Qigong) for older adults with poor sleep quality. Background Poor sleep quality exerts negative impact on life quality of old adults. The meditation-based mind-body interventions, with merits of simplicity, practicality, accessibility, and widespread dissemination, have been widely used to improve sleep in the older adults. However, the effects of MBIs on sleep quality of old adults are largely unknown. Method A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out following the PRISMA-P guidelines. Embase, PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and CNKI databases were searched to gather randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of MBIs on older adults with poor sleep quality. Study quality was evaluated by the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Results This study included 11 randomized controlled trials (with 1,052 participants) published between 2008 and 2023. Compared to the control group, there was a significant improvement in sleep quality (SMD= -0.66, 95%CI [-0.894, -0.426], P<0.00001), depression (SMD=-1.60, 95% CI [-1.89, 0.23], P=0.005), and anxiety (SMD= -1.46, 95% CI [-3.67, 0.75], P=0.026) for older adults with poor sleep quality. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the treatment effect for stress (SMD= -4.45, 95% CI [-10.24, 1.35], P=0.196). Conclusion Meditation-based mind-body interventions significantly improved the sleep quality of older adults with poor sleep quality. Nevertheless, more evidence is needed to support this.

      "abstract": "Abstract Recent years have seen growing interest in the use of metrics inspired by complexity science for the study of consciousness. Work in this field has shown remarkable results in discerning conscious from unconscious states, and in characterizing states of altered conscious experience following psychedelic intake as involving enhanced complexity. Here, we study the relationship between complexity and a different kind of altered state of consciousness: meditation. We provide a scoping review of the growing literature studying the complexity of neural activity in meditation, disentangling different families of measures, short-term (state) from long-term (trait) effects, and meditation styles. Beyond families of measures used, our review uncovers a convergence toward identifying higher complexity during the meditative state when compared to waking rest or mind-wandering and decreased baseline complexity as a trait following regular meditation practice. In doing so, this review contributes to guide current debates and provides a framework for understanding the complexity of neural activity in meditation, while suggesting practical guidelines for future research.",

      "abstract": "Advanced meditation has been associated with long- and short-term psychological changes such as bliss, profound insight, and transformation of well-being. However, most advanced meditation neuroimaging analyses have implemented primarily spatially-localized approaches, focusing on discrete regional changes in activity rather than distributed dynamics. The present study uses a geometric eigenmode decomposition of ultrahigh field-strength 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from an intensely sampled case study to investigate the complex, distributed cortical dynamics associated with advanced concentrative absorption meditation. Geometric eigenmode decomposition of advanced concentrative absorption meditation and non-meditative control task fMRI data revealed elevated global brain state power and energy patterns of specific advanced concentrative absorption meditation states compared to controls, with mid-frequency spectrum brain state power and energy following a non-random, cubic trajectory through the advanced concentrative absorption meditation sequence. Further, these brain state differences were meaningfully associated with subjective phenomenological reports of attention, intensity of advanced concentrative absorption meditation quality, and sensations. This study unites precise methodological design, a novel fMRI decomposition framework, and rigorous phenomenology to provide valuable insights into the distributed neural signatures of highly refined conscious states. These results underscore similarities and differences between advanced concentrative absorption meditation and other altered states of consciousness like those induced by psychedelics-offering insights into refined conscious states and their implications for health and well-being.",

      "abstract": "Police officers work in high-stress environments that demand emotional resilience, interpersonal skills, and effective communication. Occupational stress can negatively impact their motivation, conflict resolution abilities, and professional effectiveness. Loving-Kindness Meditation (LKM), a mindfulness-based intervention focused on cultivating compassion and empathy, has shown promise in enhancing prosocial attitudes and emotional regulation. With the rise of short video platforms, digital interventions like video-guided LKM may offer accessible mental health support for law enforcement. This study examines the effects of short video app-guided LKM on police officers\u2019 mindfulness, public service motivation (PSM), conflict resolution skills (CRSs), and communication skills (CSSs). It aims to determine whether LKM can enhance these psychological and professional competencies. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted with 110 active-duty police officers from a metropolitan police department in China, with 92 completing the study. Participants were randomly assigned to either the LKM group (n = 46) or the waitlist control group (n = 46). The intervention consisted of a 6-week short video app-guided LKM program with daily 10 min meditation sessions. Pre- and post-intervention assessments were conducted using several validated scales: the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), the Public Service Motivation Scale (PSM), the Conflict Resolution Styles Inventory (CRSI), and the Communication Competence Scale (CCS). A 2 (Group: LKM vs. Control) \u00d7 2 (Time: Pre vs. Post) mixed-design MANOVA was conducted to analyze the effects. Statistical analyses revealed significant group-by-time interaction effects for PSM (F(4,177) = 21.793, p < 0.001, \u03b72 = 0.108), CRS (F(4,177) = 20.920, p < 0.001, \u03b72 = 0.104), and CSS (F(4,177) = 49.095, p < 0.001, \u03b72 = 0.214), indicating improvements in these areas for LKM participants. However, no significant improvement was observed for mindfulness (F(4,177) = 2.850, p = 0.930, \u03b72 = 0.016). Short video app-guided LKM improves public service motivation, conflict resolution skills, and communication skills among police officers but does not significantly enhance mindfulness. These findings suggest that brief, digitally delivered compassion-focused programs can be seamlessly incorporated into routine in-service training to strengthen officers\u2019 prosocial motivation, de-escalation competence, and public-facing communication, thereby fostering more constructive police\u2013community interactions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Mindfulness meditation is a systematic training in equanimity, sensory clarity, and concentration rooted in ancient contemplative traditions. Here, we synthesized cognitive\u2013behavioral outcomes in long-term meditators (LTMs) resulting from diverse, prolonged meditation practices. Preliminary evidence suggests that LTMs exhibit increased cognitive\u2013sensory integration and decoupling of affective processes, demonstrated by enhanced interoceptive awareness, reduced negative affective pain perception, and more rational decision making. Additionally, LTMs may experience more emotional neutrality, malleable self-boundaries, and altered self-awareness. Neuroimaging findings included increased bottom-up activation, particularly within the salience network (interoception, pain, affect), and reduced connectivity between the executive (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and salience (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) networks (reduced pain). The literature also suggests reduced fear and amygdala activation (mitigated negative affect), increased temporoparietal junction activation (pre-reflective experiential processes, empathy), and altered midline default-mode network activation, which was associated with emotional neutrality and non-ordinary states of consciousness. Methodological limitations restricted the interpretation of trait effects, emphasizing the need for a unified framework to systematically investigate advanced meditation\u2019s states, stages, and endpoints using neurophenomenology. In summary, LTMs display a distinct neurophenomenological gestalt of mindfulness, wherein meditative expertise is reflected in enhanced cognitive flexibility and integration, self-regulation, and non-dual awareness\u2014signifying a potentially important form of embodied cognition.",

      "abstract": "Background\nBreath-awareness practices contribute to stress management and psychological well-being among adolescents. However, their neurobehavioural effects remain underexplored, specifically in the Indian developmental context.\n\n\nPurpose\nThis study examined how breath-based \u0100n\u0101p\u0101nasati meditation affects brain electrical activity and the subjective self-reported experiences in adolescent novice meditators posteriori a cognitive workload-inducing task.\n\n\nMethods\nAnapanasati meditation was adapted into a three-stage breath-awareness intervention framework and was administered to 45 novice adolescent meditators. Brain activity was investigated through electroencephalography (EEG), and neural oscillations were measured over the three stages, namely resting state (RS), breath counting (BC) and breath focus (BF). Further, adolescents' breath awareness self-reports were evaluated employing the Amsterdam Resting-State Questionnaire (ARSQ) following the BF stage and the breath count feedback (BCF) after the BC stage. Both the inventories displayed satisfactory psychometric properties, thus facilitating a neurobehavioural analysis in a cross-sectional within-subjects setting.\n\n\nResults\nAlpha oscillation was significantly increased throughout the intervention, indicating relaxation. Beta power in both the occipital and midline default mode network (DMN) regions during the count and focus stages exhibited significant positive associations with breath count, suggesting enhanced visual and cognitive processing. Blissfulness felt during counting breaths was also associated with enhanced state mindfulness, sharing a notable negative association with the theory of mind (TOM). State mindfulness further correlated with increased frontal alpha activity, while the theory of mind negatively predicted frontal alpha power. Lastly, exploratory analysis revealed gender differences, with females demonstrating greater frontal beta activity and state mindfulness.\n\n\nConclusion\nBreath-awareness meditation can thus be effective for promoting relaxation and blissfulness in adolescents, with possible gender-based variations influencing its impact. Moreover, the positive association of prefrontal alpha with self-reported state mindfulness and its negative association with TOM underscored an inverse interplay between inward-focused mindfulness and outward-directed social cognitive states in adolescents.",

      "abstract": "Attention is a crucial cognitive ability for sports performance. The current research aimed to investigate whether long-term mindfulness meditation (MM) intervention enhances male athletes\u2019 attentional function and alters the activity of brain regions related to attention. In this experiment, we recruited 47 professional male fencer athletes completed two main trials\u2014an MM trial and a control trial. In MM trial, the participants were provided with 3 sessions/wk (20 min/session) of mindfulness meditation training for 20 weeks. In control trial, the participants were instead assigned a mind-wandering related audio to listen to at that time. In each main trial, the five facets of mindfulness questionnaire (FFMQ), cognitive function (i.e. attention span, attention concentrativeness, attention stability, attentional network, distractibility and attentional blink), salivary cortisol, blood lactate and mental fatigue were measured at baseline (pretest) and after the intervention (posttest). The cerebral oxygenation status was recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy(fNIRS) during the cognitive function test. In cognition test, participants\u2019 attention span, attention concentrativeness, attention stability, attentional networks on task-relevant information (targets) were better in the MM group, supported by eliciting increased oxygenated haemoglobin (HbO) concentration in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. Conversely, there are no remarkable different of distractibility and attentional blink on task-irrelevant information in the MM group than in the Con group (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Moreover, a lower mental fatigue level and lower salivary cortisol concentration were observed in the MM group than in the Con group after the intervention at posttest. Overall, 20-week MM training interventions after physical training improve attentive capacity and cerebral oxygenation concentration, decrease salivary cortisol concentrations and mental fatigue. The findings suggest that long-term MM training interventions after physical training facilitates focus during competition and improves athletic performance.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Yoga Nidra meditation has been increasingly examined in recent years for its potential to enhance psychological well\u2010being. However, few studies have examined its biological effects\u2014such as diurnal cortisol patterns particularly in larger samples using pre\u2010post designs. The primary objective of this randomised controlled trial was to examine both the psychological (stress, anxiety, depression, rumination, sleep, satisfaction with life) and the biological effects (diurnal salivary cortisol) of Yoga Nidra. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 intervention groups (EG1: 11 min Yoga Nidra, n = 101; EG2: 30 min Yoga Nidra, n = 80), an active control group (AC: 10 min music, n = 74), or a waitlist control group (WC, n = 107). The intervention was delivered online via pre\u2010recorded audio files and practiced ideally daily over 2 months. Significant improvements were observed for the 11\u2010min Yoga Nidra group compared to the WC (effect sizes d = 0.08\u20130.16). Regular practice was associated with reductions in total cortisol and steeper diurnal slopes. Additionally, the short form significantly reduced depression compared to the AC (d = 0.13). The long form of Yoga Nidra showed an increase in acting with awareness (d = 0.10) compared to the short form. It also exceeded the effects of EG1 when compared to the AC and WC, including a flatter cortisol wake\u2010up reaction. The importance of small effects through economic interventions for health\u2010promoting behaviour is highlighted.",

A single-arm pilot clinical trial was conducted in a controlled environment during a 9-day intensive retreat of Arhatic Yoga meditation practices with vegetarian diet. Oral and fecal samples of 24 practitioners were collected at the start (Day0: T1), middle (Day3: T2), and end (Day9:T3) of the retreat. Targeted 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed for both oral and gut samples. Functional pathway predictions was identified using phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt2). DESeq2 was used to identify the differential abundant taxa. Various statistical analyses were performed to assess the significant changes in the data. Our findings revealed that Arhatic Yoga meditation together with a vegetarian diet led to changes in the oral and gut microbiome profiles within the 9-day retreat. Oral microbiome profile showed a significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05) difference in the species richness and evenness at the end of study, while non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) confirmed the shift in the gut microbiome profile of the practitioners by T2 timepoint, which was further supported by PERMANOVA analysis (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Health-benefiting microbes known to improve the gastrointestinal and gut-barrier functions, immune modulation, and gut-brain axis were enriched. Gut microbiome of both beginner and advanced Arhatic Yoga practitioners showed similar trends of convergence by the end of study. This implies a strong selection pressure by Arhatic Yoga meditation together with a vegetarian diet on the beneficial gut microbiome. This pilot study demonstrates that Arhatic Yoga meditation practices combined with a vegetarian diet during a short intensive retreat resulted in enrichment of known health-promoting microbes. Such microbial consortia may be developed for potential health benefits and used as probiotics to improve the gastrointestinal and immune systems, as well as functions mediated by the gut-brain axis.

      "abstract": "In this study, I recounted my experience using mantra meditation during a phenomenological study for the purposes of bracketing. The efficacy and purpose of bracketing have been debated from Husserl (1931), whose aimed was to achieve objectivity, to Heidegger (1962) who advocated for immersion of the researcher, through the French school (Merleau-Ponty, 1964) of middle ground, by whom bracketing was seen as the process to unearth and suspend biases for the better understanding of participants\u2019 experiences (Arsel, 2017; Creswell & Creswell, 2017; Creswell & Poth, 2016; Fischer & Guzel, 2023). In this study, however, I propose another approach to bracketing that expands beyond phenomenology and the duality of objectivity or immersion. I propose that bracketing, with the aim of meditation is inseparable from qualitative research. Meditation, as a form of bracketing, provokes the researcher to be fully present ensuring that participants\u2019 experiences are heard and interpreted in a faithful manner. In this orientation, the goal of bracketing is not to rid one\u2019s subjectivity but to allow subjectivity to be diminished and the researcher to be fully present to the other.",

      "abstract": "Background: Chronic pain affects over 25% of U.S. adults and is a leading cause of disability. Mindfulness meditation (MM) is a nonpharmacologic approach to manage pain and improve well-being. Despite mounting evidence supporting its efficacy, MM remains underutilized in medical practice. Understanding physicians' engagement with MM and the barriers they face can inform strategies for integration into clinical care. This study assessed physicians' attitudes toward MM, including barriers to practice and their likelihood of recommending it to patients. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of U.S. physicians was conducted from April to July 2024. Participants provided information on demographics, health struggles, and meditation practices and completed the Determinants of Meditation Practice Inventory-Revised to evaluate barriers. Results: Of 171 respondents, 37.4% meditated weekly, primarily for stress relief. Regular meditators were significantly more likely to recommend MM to patients (90.6%) compared to past (75%) or non-meditators (46.8%; P < .0001). Common barriers included time constraints (50.9%) and prioritizing other tasks (51.5%). Non- and past meditators reported low perceived benefits and inadequate knowledge (P \u2264 .0001). Conclusion: Physicians' engagement with MM influences their likelihood of recommending it. Addressing barriers through education, training, and promoting brief practices could enhance MM adoption and integration into clinical care.",

      "abstract": "There is growing scientific interest in advanced meditation, and particularly the Theravada Buddhist advanced concentrative absorption meditation known as jhana (ACAM-J). ACAM-J includes a series of eight consecutive meditative states, which are radically altered states of consciousness. The neuroscience of ACAM-J, specifically brain reorganization, remains underspecified in part due to the difficulty of finding and studying expert ACAM-J meditators and challenges related to laboratory investigation of ACAM-J. Using a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique applied to human functional neuroimaging in an intensive case study, we investigated brain reorganization during ACAM-J. We applied linear mixed models and correlations to explore relations among brain reorganization and ACAM-J phenomenology. Results demonstrated that ACAM-J induces disruption of the hierarchical organization of the brain by shifting the gradients toward a more globally integrated rather than segregated state between sensory-related and higher-order cognitive regions. Additionally, ACAM-J induces a separation between sensory-related and attention modulation-related regions, resulting in greater differentiation in functional organization of these regions, consistent with phenomenological reports. This study highlights the need for further research into brain reorganization and health-related implications of both short-term and long-term practice of ACAM-J. Key points/highlights The neuroscience of advanced concentrative absorption meditation (ACAM) has the potential to improve our knowledge of well-being and altered states of consciousness but remains underexplored due to methodological challenges. We investigated functional reorganization of the brain during ACAM-J using gradient analysis and demonstrated that ACAM-J disrupts the hierarchical organization of the brain during meditation. Additionally, we demonstrated that ACAM-J increases differentiation between primary sensory areas and areas related to attention modulation.",

We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 96 patients in an 11-bed surgical ICU at a South Korean university hospital. The control group received usual sleep care, whereas the intervention group received an additional 20-minute virtual reality-based mindfulness and relaxation meditation before bedtime. Using the Verran and Snyder-Halpern Sleep Scale, we found significantly improved subjective sleep quality in the intervention group compared with controls during both the first (47.82 vs 39.75, P = .015) and second nights (50.26 vs 43.65, P = .025) of ICU admission. However, objective sleep measurements using Fitbit devices showed no significant differences in total sleep time between groups for either the first (384.59 vs 358.19 minutes, P = .450) or second night (319.94 vs 310.77 minutes, P = .807). Delirium incidence was similar between groups (12.2% vs 12.8%, P = .938). These findings suggest the need for larger-scale studies with robust experimental designs to definitively establish the impact of virtual reality meditation on sleep quality and delirium in ICU patients.",

Thus, integrating holistic approaches into core curriculum is essential to support the preparation for spiritually informed, standardized, ethical care. The purpose of this qualitative research project was to inquire into the inspiration of Mahavakyam Meditation practice, adapted from Master Teacher Sen\u2019s Ancient Secrets of Success system. Findings elucidate how Mahavakyam Meditation influences social work students\u2019 self-awareness, resilience, and wellbeing as an intervention tool. The Vedic science of thought-word creation is contemplated. The authors excavated six themes through data analysis: reduced anxiety and stress, increased concentration, deepened self-awareness, decreased negative self-talk and greater self-compassion, enhanced relationships, and spiritual connection. This inquiry offers a spiritual trauma-informed practical tool to support helping professional students through their studies and practice. We recommend further research to explore the effective implementation of Mahavakyam Meditation into helping professional curriculum as well as clinical and community interventions to best support students and clinicians to build resilience when they endure their own traumatic experiences.",

Methods: Based on inclusion criteria, 44 studies were selected for the review and categorized into three major areas: attention, academic performance, and mental health (stress/anxiety). Areas were systemically reviewed and synthesized. Results: Review findings suggest that, while appearing to have inconsistent impacts on academic performance, meditation practice with college students demonstrates more conclusive evidence in regard to attention including mind-wandering and the reduction of stress and anxiety. Conclusion: Meditation interventions continue to show promise as alternative treatments for mental health on campuses. However, well-designed studies are still needed to answer questions on meditation practices with students, including dosage, specific techniques, and impact on diverse populations.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Black Americans suffer from disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Psychosocial stress contributes to this disparity. Previous studies reported that the Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique reduced CVD risk factors, surrogate endpoints, and clinical events in high-risk populations. However, no study has evaluated the effects of stress reduction with meditation on surrogate CVD markers such as carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) along with CVD clinical events. Therefore, this randomized clinical trial evaluated the long-term effects of meditation and health education (HE) on cIMT and CVD events in high-risk Black adults. Materials and methods Participants were Black women and men with CVD or at high risk who were randomized to either TM or HE. The primary outcome was a change in cIMT measured using B-mode ultrasound at baseline and 12\u202fmonths. The main secondary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) at 5\u202fyears (maximum) of follow-up. Other secondary outcomes were MACE at 1 and 10\u202fyears of follow-up, blood pressure, and serum lipids after 1\u202fyear. Exploratory variables were a comparison of cIMT changes to historical controls and MACE after 14\u202fyears. Results There were 197 randomized participants, of whom 136 completed posttest for cIMT. After 1\u202fyear, the TM and HE groups showed average cIMT changes of \u22120.0004 and \u22120.0003\u202fmm, respectively, with no significant difference between the groups. Additionally, there were no significant differences between the groups in lipid levels or BP. However, both TM and HE groups showed prevention of progression of cIMT compared to historical controls at 12\u202fmonths. In the survival analysis of MACE, there was a 65% relative risk reduction in the TM group after 5 (maximum) years of follow-up (HR\u202f=\u202f0.346; 95% CI\u202f=\u202f0.134\u20130.893; p\u202f=\u202f0.017). At 1 and 10\u202fyears of follow-up, there were significant risk reductions in the TM vs. HE group, which was not significant at 14\u202fyears (all yearly maximums). Discussion Both treatment groups demonstrated prevention of progression of cIMT over 12\u202fmonths compared to historical controls. However, the TM group showed a relative risk reduction for MACE of 65% at 5\u202fyears. Therefore, as a lifestyle modification method, TM may be useful in the secondary prevention of CVD in this and possibly other high-risk groups.

      "abstract": "Mindfulness meditation is associated with functional brain changes in regions subserving higher order cognitive processes such as attention. However, no research to date has probed these areas in meditators using combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG). This study aimed to investigate whether cortical reactivity to TMS differs in a community sample of experienced mindfulness meditators when compared to matched controls. TMS was applied to the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC) of 19 controls and 15 meditators while brain responses were measured using EEG. TMS-evoked potentials (P60 and N100) were compared between the groups using repeated measures ANOVAs and Mann\u2013Whitney U tests where appropriate, and exploratory analyses using the whole EEG scalp field were performed to test whether TMS-evoked global neural response strength or the distribution of neural activity differed between groups. Meditators were found to have statistically larger P60/N100 ratios in response to both left and right hemisphere DLPFC stimulation compared to controls (both left and right pFDR\u2009<\u20090.01, BF10\u2009>\u200939). No differences were observed in P60 or N100 amplitudes when examined independently. We also found preliminary evidence for differences in the spatial distribution of neural activity 269\u2013332 ms post stimulation. These differences in the distribution of neural activity around 300 ms after stimulation suggest that meditators may have differences in connectivity between cortical and subcortical brain regions, potentially reflecting greater inhibitory activity in frontal regions. This research contributes to our current understanding of the neurophysiology of mindfulness and highlights opportunities for further exploration into the mechanisms underpinning the benefits of mindfulness meditation. This study is not preregistered.",

      "abstract": "Mindfulness meditation training has been associated with improved cognitive and sport performance, but the mechanisms linking mindfulness, cognitive engagement, and performance remain unclear, especially in simultaneous assessments during sports tasks. This study explored whether brief mindfulness meditation (BMM) training impacts shooting performance and cognitive engagement. We hypothesized that: (1) the meditation group would show improved shooting performance compared to the control group, and (2) daily 15-min mindfulness meditation would enhance cognitive engagement, reflected by brain activity. Sixty participants were randomly assigned to either an 18-day mindfulness meditation group or a control group. A virtual reality (VR) shooting task assessed performance before and after the intervention, while portable EEG devices recorded brain activity. The meditation group improved shooting scores by 6.56 points (p\u2009=\u20090.036) and showed a higher Beta/(Alpha\u2009+\u2009Theta) ratio\u2014a marker of cognitive engagement reflecting greater focus and alertness versus relaxation\u2014in left frontal regions (AF3, AF7, Fp1), but not right regions (AF4, AF8, Fp2). These findings suggest that BMM can improve both motor precision and mental focus, making it a valuable tool for athletes and professionals in high-precision fields such as surgery and aviation. Integrating short BMM sessions into training routines may help optimize focus and performance.",

      "abstract": "This study focuses on classifying multiple sessions of loving kindness meditation (LKM) and non-meditation electroencephalography (EEG) data. This novel study focuses on using multiple sessions of EEG data from a single individual to train a machine learning pipeline, and then using a new session data from the same individual for the classification. Here, two meditation techniques, LKM-Self and LKM-Others were compared with non-meditation EEG data for 12 participants. Among many tested, three BCI pipelines we built produced promising results, successfully detecting features in meditation/ non-meditation EEG data. While testing different feature extraction algorithms, a common neural network structure was used as the classification algorithm to compare the performance of the feature extraction algorithms. For two of those pipelines, Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) and Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) were successfully used as feature extraction algorithms where both these algorithms are significantly new for meditation EEG. As a novel concept, the third BCI pipeline used a feature extraction algorithm that fused the features of CSP and STFT, achieving the highest classification accuracies among all tested pipelines. Analyses were conducted using EEG data of 3, 4 or 5 sessions, totaling 3960 tests on the entire dataset. At the end of the study, when considering all the tests, the overall classification accuracy using SCP alone was 67.1%, and it was 67.8% for STFT alone. The algorithm combining the features of CSP and STFT achieved an overall classification accuracy of 72.9% which is more than 5% higher than the other two pipelines. At the same time, the highest mean classification accuracy for the 12 participants was achieved using the pipeline with the combination of CSP STFT algorithm, reaching 75.5% for LKM-Self/ non-meditation for the case of 5 sessions of data. Additionally, the highest individual classification accuracy of 88.9% was obtained by the participant no. 14. Furthermore, the results showed that the classification accuracies for all three pipelines increased with the number of training sessions increased from 2 to 3 and then to 4. The study was successful in classifying a new session of EEG meditation/ non-meditation data after training machine learning algorithms using a different set of session data, and this achievement will be beneficial in the development of algorithms that support meditation.",

      "abstract": "While there exists a large body of research on the possibility of measuring certain aspects of human development, what might be called inner development has mostly been neglected, in particular as it pertains to advanced meditation. A central aspect of this kind of development, which we call meditative development, is associated with access to bliss, peace, wisdom, and the reduction of suffering, which have been regarded as highly desirable or even ultimate aims of human life. The potential for such development is currently being scientifically studied and developmentally mapped. While the use of maps to guide meditation during practice has been criticized, the conceptualization of a transformative process involving a metaphorical death and rebirth, or the dissolution of an old identity and the emergence of a new one, is common across various wisdom traditions. In the meditative traditions, some maps, such as the one described by Mah\u0101s\u012b Say\u0101daw, describe this process in a way that is both highly detailed and grounded in experience. Here, we propose an outline of the process of metaphorical \u201cdeath and rebirth\u201d in advanced meditation, which may form a foundation for the scientific investigation of meditative development and support a deeper understanding of what it means to be human.",

      "abstract": "Background: Law enforcement is a high-stress profession, with officers frequently exposed to traumatic events, leading to mental health challenges such as communication anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anger management difficulties, and mood disorders. Mindfulness meditation (MM), particularly when guided through short video applications, has shown promise in addressing these issues by enhancing emotional regulation and resilience. Objective: This study explores the effects of an 8-week MM intervention, delivered via short video apps, on communication anxiety, PTSD, anger management, and mood disorders in police officers. Methods: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted with 110 full-time police officers aged 25\u201355 in China. The final 92 eligible participants were divided into two groups: the MM group (n = 46) and the control group (n = 46). The intervention consisted of daily 10\u201315 min video-guided MM sessions. Pre- and post-intervention measures included validated questionnaires assessing communication anxiety (PRCA-24), PTSD (PCL-5), anger management (STAXI-2), and mood disorders (DASS-21). Data analysis was performed using MANOVA. Results: The intervention group showed significant improvements in communication anxiety (F = 8.505, p = 0.004), PTSD (F = 25.831, p < 0.001), anger management (F = 4.968, p = 0.027), and mood disorders (F = 13.058, p < 0.001) compared to the control group. These improvements were supported by significant interaction effects between group and time, indicating that the MM intervention had a positive impact on these mental health variables. Conclusions: Video-guided MM delivered via short video apps significantly reduced communication anxiety, PTSD symptoms, and mood disorders, and improved anger management among police officers. These findings highlight the potential of digital MM interventions as a scalable and accessible tool for enhancing mental well-being and resilience in law enforcement personnel.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Objectives The rapid aging of the global population necessitates innovative interventions to address older adults\u2019 mental health. This pilot study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a 4-week, 8-session nature-mindfulness-compassion program using immersive virtual reality (Embodied-and-Embedded-Mindfulness-Compassion-Framework \u2013 Virtual-Reality (EEMCF-VR)) for older adults\u2019 mental health. Methods Following a mixed-methods, two-arm, open-label RCT design, 24 older adults (Mage\u2009=\u200975.1, SD\u2009=\u20096.58) were randomly assigned to EEMCF-VR (n\u2009=\u200912) or a psychoeducational pamphlet control group (n\u2009=\u200912). Participants completed self-report assessments of stress, positive and negative emotions, coping self-efficacy, psychosocial well-being, mindfulness, and nature connectedness at baseline (T1), midpoint (T2), post-intervention (T3), and 4-week follow-up (T4). Additionally, the EEMCF-VR group completed program feedback (T3) and simulator sickness (T1-T3) questionnaires. Results EEMCF-VR met feasibility benchmarks (recruitment targets achieved, attrition\u2009<\u200915%) and was well-tolerated (minimal simulator sickness). Participant feedback indicated high acceptability. The EEMCF-VR group reported significantly lower stress and negative emotions at T2 and T4 compared to controls. Qualitative analysis highlighted perceived benefits and components to retain (e.g. video content) or refine (e.g. headset weight). Conclusions EEMCF-VR demonstrated feasibility and acceptability, with promising effects on stress and mood, warranting investigation in larger trials. Clinical Implications EEMCF-VR shows potential as a scalable intervention to reduce older adults\u2019 emotional distress.",

      "abstract": "This paper represents an attempt to investigate some aspects of Vedic religiosity, as represented in the R\u0325gveda (R\u0325V), in comparison with the P\u0101li Canon on the themes of cognition, contemplative practice, and the theory of knowledge. It aims to argue that the metaphors in R\u0325V, for instance, fire, the chariot, the yoke, light, and the ocean, bear proto-Buddhist ideas that have influenced Buddhist meditative practices. These metaphors reflect a theory of knowledge and cognition that shares certain features with the P\u0101li Canon. The Vedic seer, the figure around whom this discussion revolves, is a forerunner of the Buddhist practitioner, and the themes of surmounting ignorance and gaining knowledge are common to both of them. The article identifies two major metaphorical fields: one related to knowledge and cognition and the other related to contemplative practice and liberation. The analysis investigates how Vedic metaphors represent an early conceptualization of \u201ctechnics\u201d, both bodily and contemplative. It underlines similarities between Vedic contemplative exercises, usually understood as a form of prayer, and Buddhist meditation. While the Vedic tradition is focused on divine association, the Buddhist framework reinterprets these ideas within a human-centered perspective. The transformation of Vedic metaphors into Buddhist concepts shows an intricate dialogue rather than an absolute rejection of Vedic traditions.",

      "abstract": "The article delves into the need for an anthropological exploration of consciousness in the modern context. While anthropology's core focus has always been the study of the human subject, this study argues that consciousness has emerged as a fundamental aspect that underpins all human phenomena. The historical trajectory of anthropology, from its positivist leanings to contemporary shifts like the phenomenological and ontological turns, is examined to highlight the evolving perspective on subjectivity and alterity. The author's ethnographic studies, particularly within the realm of contemplative practices like traditional Buddhist meditation and mindfulness, reveal a crucial connection between consciousness and anthropological inquiry, challenging the inherent bias and dualistic thinking within anthropology, particularly concerning the dichotomy of self and other, evident even in studies of meditation. The proposal of \u201cmindful ethnography\u201d is introduced as a means to transcend this dualism, drawing inspiration from Buddhist philosophy. The study presents consciousness as a central concern for anthropology, calling for a reevaluation of traditional frameworks and the adoption of a more mindful and non\u2010dualistic approach to anthropological research. Through a thorough investigation of consciousness, the article seeks to provide a nuanced understanding of human experience and reshape the trajectory of anthropological inquiry in a modern context.",

      "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) improves, traditional alignment strategies may falter in the face of unpredictable self-improvement, hidden subgoals, and the sheer complexity of intelligent systems. Inspired by contemplative wisdom traditions, we show how four axiomatic principles can instil a resilient Wise World Model in AI systems. First, mindfulness enables self-monitoring and recalibration of emergent subgoals. Second, emptiness forestalls dogmatic goal fixation and relaxes rigid priors. Third, non-duality dissolves adversarial self-other boundaries. Fourth, boundless care motivates the universal reduction of suffering. We find that prompting AI to reflect on these principles improves performance on the AILuminate Benchmark (d=.96) and boosts cooperation and joint-reward on the Prisoner's Dilemma task (d=7+). We offer detailed implementation strategies at the level of architectures, constitutions, and reinforcement on chain-of-thought. For future systems, active inference may offer the self-organizing and dynamic coupling capabilities needed to enact Contemplative AI in embodied agents.",

      "abstract": "For all the gifts of healing that the field of psychology has offered, its colonial roots of disconnection and domination continue to obstruct collective well-being in three particular ways: individualism, disembodiment, and secularization. We offer a healing and liberatory antidote: love as a decolonial praxis of reconnection to each other, to our bodies, and to Spirit. We reflexively illustrate this praxis of love in a process of creating and contextualizing a community intervention of love, critical contemplative dialogues (CCD). The CCD intervention, tailored for Black, Indigenous, and peoples of color and piloted with seven contemplatives, is discussed within a broader community-based participatory research project and community care process: Vocalizing Oppression and Interconnection in Contemplative and Embodiment Spaces. We highlight three fundamental epistemological frameworks for the intervention: critical, contemplative, and dialogic. The pilot CCD manifests the praxis of love through themes of witnessing in relationship, engaging in dialogues, centering embodied practice, honoring emergence in the moment, and becoming ceremony. We reflexively identify eight emergent guiding values, centering radical healing and liberation, with illustration of their presence in our process. Looking forward, the trajectory of this work will continue with a broadening and deepening of the CCD community intervention within Vocalizing Oppression and Interconnection in Contemplative and Embodiment Spaces. We reflect on broader themes demonstrated in the collective practice of love and offer recommendations and future directions for applications of these healing and liberatory processes in the field of psychology.

      "abstract": "This study took place in a high-level educational framework; it evaluated the effects of four contemplative practices: Focused Attention Meditation (FAM), Open Monitoring Meditation (OMM), Loving Kindness Meditation (LKM), and Self-Loving Kindness Meditation (self-LKM). The focus was on their impact on teamwork competencies, as well as how they were influenced by both the individual and the group mindfulness levels. Using a pre-post experimental design, three groups were compared: the first engaged in FAM, OMM, and LKM (Core Mindfulness Training); the second in OMM, LKM, and self-LKM (Empathy Expansion Training); and a control group participated in no meditation activities. The Experience Sampling Method (ESM) was used to evaluate state mindfulness and teamwork competencies in Empathy Expansion Training. Teamwork competencies were measured across two main categories: empathy skills and interpersonal skills. Both training interventions significantly increased teamwork competencies. Core Mindfulness Training enhanced Perspective-taking, Fantasy, Extraversion, and Initiating relationships. Conversely, Empathy Expansion Training more effectively improved Empathic concern and Openness. The study confirmed the influence of both individual and group state mindfulness on teamwork competencies, though the relationships did not reach statistical significance. The integration of contemplative practices within educational settings significantly enhances teamwork competencies, with distinct effects of different meditation practices on various competencies. These findings suggest that training frameworks incorporating contemplative practices improve cognitive and emotional well-being. Additionally, they enhance essential interpersonal skills critical for effective teamwork. This study is not preregistered.",

      "abstract": "What is the role of contemplative practices in the movement toward a more \"just\" criminal legal system? Over the past 8 years, we have explored this question through parallel lines of research and practice with police officers and incarcerated individuals who, despite very different relationships to this system, are all traumatized by an unjust system that erodes the humanity of all those connected to it. This article integrates our perspectives and critical reflections on this work with qualitative data from three groups we have engaged as research participants and community advisors. First, we share excerpts from semistructured interviews with police officers suggesting that an overemphasis on individual resilience and well-being may limit the extent to which mindfulness practices lead to interpersonal benefits or raise critical awareness of officers' role in an unjust criminal legal system. Second, we share perspectives from community advisors on how future research and training with police officers can be more responsive to community concerns and priorities. Third, after sharing reflections on offering mindfulness practices in prisons, we summarize recommendations from an advisory board of formerly incarcerated individuals on how mindfulness can best support community reentry. To advance justice through contemplative practice and research, our experiences suggest we must be explicit about the ethical framework in which mindfulness practices are offered; bring these practices to individuals and organizations with the capability to influence systems change; and foreground shared humanity above perceived differences for individuals with very different relationships to the criminal legal system.

      "abstract": "\n Empathy fatigue and burnout are at an all-time high within the mental health professions, and there remains a need to understand protective factors that can address these conditions. The current qualitative study investigated how contemplative practice, such as mindfulness meditation and movement-based practices, can support the remediation of empathy fatigue and burnout. Eleven mental health counselors with extensive contemplative practice experience were interviewed, and data were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Findings revealed that contemplative practice enhanced self-attunement and self-compassionate inquiry, alleviated the symptomology of empathy fatigue and burnout, enhanced transcendent meaning and purpose, promoted therapeutic boundaries, deepened the cultivation of compassion, supported disengagement of client influence after session, and enhanced a sense of personal agency in one's workplace. From this study, we demonstrate that contemplative practices can support a wide variety of flexible and adaptive responses that may mitigate empathy fatigue and burnout or prevent them altogether.",

While it is not uncommon for researchers to draw on their existing skills in mindfulness and other contemplative practices, I propose that contemplative practice is central to narrative inquiry research, making it both a qualitative methodology that can be enriched by contemplative practice but also a research methodology that is contemplative at its core.",

Herein, the research is conducted through a quasi- experimental design based on a study of two groups. The sample is comprised of fifty preschoolers with twenty-five preschoolers in each group. Group 1, the experimental group, undergoes training via two steps: organized experiences and individual emotional coaching. Group 2, the control group, receives the normal experience. The duration of the research is ten weeks. Data are analyzed using the mean, standard deviation, t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results demonstrate that the experimental group had higher emotional competence than previously. Both mean scores for emotional knowledge and emotional regulation reached 0.05 level of significance.",

      "abstract": "Undertaking fieldwork within the educational spaces of neoliberal academia underscored how ethnography, as a quotidian ethical tradition, is in dire need of fostering more contemplative practitioners. To illustrate, I narrate a tale of profound failure in self-care triggered by the coercive actions of an unlikely participant-researcher. Anchored around the recollection of an emotionally traumatic memory, I critically reflect on a choice to ignore my own well-being for the self-perceived guarantee of safeguarding field notes. I identify this decision to have been broadly shaped by extractivist pressures channeled by today\u2019s higher education landscape. In asking ethnographers and other researchers to contribute to, and (or) engage in affective accounts concerning personal vulnerability in the field, I call for a greater instilling of contemplative research principles. Practicing fieldwork with such mindfulness will help promote researcher health and better illuminate uncompassionate neoliberal inequities, while also delivering severely untapped epistemic value.",

      "abstract": "Mindfulness-based interventions that lack cultural resonance and fail to address liberation can fall short in supporting the well-being of communities impacted by social injustices. This study aimed to identify and illuminate how the lived experiences of two Black women psychologists informed the creation of mindfulness-based, emancipatory contemplative practice programs designed for Black and other racially minoritized groups who have experienced colonial-cultural trauma and ongoing oppression. The study utilized collaborative autoethnography, a relational and reflexive qualitative research approach. Guided by a theoretical framework based on the African wisdom of Sankofa (return, retrieval, revitalization), the authors constructed narratives describing the emergence of contemplative practice programs from their own experiences of cultural reclamation and liberation. One program introduces soulfulness as an entry to mindful presence and awareness, while the other invites embodiment through water-based contemplative healing practices. Through introspection and collaborative reflection, the authors identified four themes conceptualized as emancipatory pathways: (1) returning \"home\"; (2) sacredness of culture, spirituality, and nature; (3) movement and flow; and (4) release, resistance, and reimagining. These pathways reflect a liberatory-decolonial ethos and offer healing-oriented recommendations for expanding experiential awareness and enhancing well-being. It is suggested that mindfulness and contemplative practice interventions with Black and other racially minoritized communities can be enhanced by centering cultural resonance, addressing the harmful disconnections of coloniality and oppression, and integrating these four emancipatory pathways into program design and delivery. By prioritizing reclamation and liberation, mindfulness-based programs can advance a more inclusive, transformative, and justice-oriented approach to individual, relational, and collective well-being.

      "abstract": "Increasing percentages of children are entering kindergarten with clinically significant attentional, social-emotional, and behavioral difficulties associated with trauma, attachment, and/or other developmental factors (Rosen, 2023). These difficulties interfere with self-regulation and meaningful engagement in school. Without more intensive treatment during the early elementary years, many of these children will likely experience deleterious outcomes. \u00a0\u00a0Integrated Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (I-MTSS) have become a widely adopted, comprehensive service delivery framework in schools for enhancing academic, social-emotional, and behavioral outcomes (National Center on Intensive Intervention, 2021). However, despite decades of I-MTSS training and technical assistance, system, grade, and student level outcomes have remained relatively stagnant. Therefore, it is critical that the extensive body of knowledge and empirical support associated with contemplative neuroscience make its way into I-MTSS models and the hands of school-based practitioners. Importantly, neuroscientific findings related to neuroplasticity and mind-body connectedness have shown that contemplative practices strengthen the neural networks associated with positive mental health (Luberto et al., 2018). Given the heightened advantage of neuroplasticity during early childhood development, practices such as breathing, stretching, and gratitude play a salient role in helping at-risk children cultivate improved levels of self-regulation toward resiliency (Fandakova & Hartley, 2020). This paper will explore the critical role of contemplative neuroscience within early elementary school-based prevention efforts. Further studies are needed to inform the impact of mindfulness intervention relative to the development of self-regulation and resilience during earlier stages of neural development.",

      "abstract": "The current study explores the impact of the implementation of contemplative pedagogy in the reduction of foreign language anxiety among undergraduate students of English Language Teaching in Pakistan. The study used a quasi-experimental design with 120 participants in three state universities in Punjab in 12 weeks during the fall 2024. The experimental group was given training that included mindfulness exercises, reflective journaling, and breath practices whereas the control group was given classical training. The collection of data was done using the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale used pre- and post-intervention, semi-structured interviews with 15 participants, and classroom observation notes. The paired-sample t-tests conducted to analyze quantitatively determined that there was statistically significant resulting reduction of anxiety in the experimental group over the control group. Qualitative thematic analysis revealed that there are five dominant themes, namely, improved self-awareness, better emotional management, heightened classroom engagement, coping-development, and learner-autonomy. The findings triangulated show that contemplative practices are promising strategies of anxiety reduction in ELT, especially in applying to communication apprehension and fear of negative evaluation. By playing a role in developing new literature on holistic practices in language instruction, the study will offer an empirical basis of why integrating contemplative pedagogy in Pakistani contexts of higher learning is helpful.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores the origins and development of the \u201ccontemplative psychotherapy\u201d project in the United States, emerging around psychoanalyst Edward Podvoll and the intellectual environment at Naropa University during the 1970s and 1980s. It situates Podvoll's work within the broader dialogue between Buddhism and Western psychotherapy, highlighting how his contributions shed light on this dynamic and complex encounter. The paper begins by outlining Podvoll's psychiatric and psychoanalytic background, then examines the establishment of contemplative psychotherapy at Naropa, and finally discusses the creation of the Windhorse community therapy model\u2014while contextualising Podvoll's dialogues with influential figures such as Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa, Erik Erikson, Manfred Bleuler, and Oliver Sacks. Drawing on published and unpublished material by Podvoll, it argues that his work exemplified a pioneering effort to integrate Buddhist and psychoanalytic perspectives on mental health and recovery. At the same time, the paper reflects on some of the conceptual and therapeutic tensions that arise when spiritual and clinical paradigms converge. By examining contemplative psychotherapy as both a historical case study and a continuing experiment, the paper contributes to ongoing debates about the possibilities\u2014and limits\u2014of East\u2013West intersections in psychological practice.",

One instance of this is the early nineteenth century lay Anglican and poet, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who in turn has influenced Daniel Hardy, an Anglican theologian. The activity of worship is examined in depth as a \u2018contemplative pragmatic\u2019 through which God transforms humankind, and so divine communication establishes the deep interrelationship of worship, moral discernment, cultural expression and human transformation, as shown in the writings of such Anglican theologians as Timothy Sedgwick and Rowan Williams. Two examples of this are given from South Africa and Wales, both of which were witnessed by the author. The article concludes with some reflections on gender, liturgy and culture, and the manner in which this article lays the foundation for further dialogue with indigenous culture and worship worldwide.",

Both share the insight that careful listening to ourselves, \u201cothers\u201d and the divine (albeit by different names) is one of the first steps toward building understanding between seemingly opposed entities. Together, they can serve as powerful resources for healing the divide between Catholic feminist theologies and the Roman Catholic Curia and, in so doing, offer hope to our often polarized and suffering world.",

      "abstract": "\n In this publication, the authors offer an experience in the theoretical construction of a cosmological concept based on the idea of God as a Contemplative. The specifics of this model are revealed in comparison with similar schemes from the history of philosophy. The author's approach is consistent with the principles of the New Testament revelation, as well as modern scientific data. The article shows a way to overcome the typical problems of classical cosmogonic concepts for European philosophy, starting from Antiquity. The article presents the problems of typical solutions to the cosmological question in European philosophy and offers the experience of a consistent model of the coexistence of God as the Absolute and the worlds generated by him, including material ones similar to the observable universe, based on the category of \"contemplation\". This category is briefly considered by the authors in a historical and theological context, then a general description of the new theological and cosmological model is given. The authors reveal the paradigmatic limitations of the philosophical understanding of God, focusing on the need to take into account the influence of natural philosophical beliefs of a particular era, which are reflected in religious doctrines (along with the personal experience of a particular thinker). In the second half of the article, specific conclusions from the proposed theological and philosophical concept are indicated: 1) cosmological conclusions (divine ideas and the way they are implemented in the world; the question of theodicy; understanding divine Providence); 2) anthropological (human phenomenon; changing approach to human rationality; characterization of God's will in relation to individual freedom); 3) ethical-soteriological (communion with God, divine revelation and salvation; comprehension of certain ethical categories within the framework of a new concept; ontological meaning of heaven and hell). The presented philosophical and religious concept of the \"Contemplative God\" represents a fundamentally new direction within the framework of religious and philosophical thought. This model is distinguished by its uniqueness and internal logical consistency, being free from the limitations and disadvantages inherent in previous philosophical systems. Its theoretical significance and originality can arouse wide interest in the scientific and philosophical community, opening up new perspectives for research in this field.\n",

In doing this, we will look at how contemplative engagement with these types of gardens generates meaning(s) in the lived experience of viewers. In other words, the aesthetic and contemplative principles that inform dry landscape garden design will provide us with a framework for the objective, given aspects of the experience while phenomenological analysis will grant us a window into the subjective, felt aspects of the experience. Our discussion will focus on what is called the \u201cquintessential\u201d Zen garden; the dry stone garden at Ry\u014dan-ji Zen temple in Kyoto. After an overview of the \u201cart of garden making\u201d in Japan, our discussion will outline the aesthetic and contemplative sensibility that informs the Zen tradition of dry landscape garden design. In particular, the discussion will focus on the non-dual emphasis that underlies Zen thought and practice and explore how experiential reports of viewing Ry\u014dan-ji echo this non-dual sensibility. The discussion will explore this experience as a \u201ctwo-way\u201d understanding or dialogue that constitutes an aesthetic and contemplative \u201cliteracy\u201d resulting in the felt experience of a new or different \u201cway of seeing\u201d.",

      "abstract": "Detached self-observation, a central dimension of mindfulness meditation, has emerged as a key metacognitive and emotional-regulatory capacity across psychology, education, and neuroscience. This theoretical paper proposes meditation as a developmental catalyst, drawing on contemporary scholarship. Detached observation is reframed here as a culturally mediated competence grounded in both phenomenological embodiment and symbolic internalization. Drawing on recent research in contemplative neuroscience, cultural psychology, dynamical systems theory, and virtue ethics, the paper explores how practices of self-observation foster cognitive-affective flexibility, reflective wisdom, and prosocial behavior. Crucially, the paper also considers potential contraindications, including the risk of depersonalization and cultural misalignment, highlighting the importance of context-sensitive application. Meditation is proposed as a dynamic developmental catalyst, with implications for personal transformation and collective well-being. The paper integrates cultural mediation theory, embodied phenomenology, and transpersonal and dynamical systems perspectives on psychological development. Implications are outlined for educational, therapeutic, and civic contexts across diverse contemplative practices.",

The purpose of this paper is to respond to these calls through a focus on the work of Jill Roe on alternative spiritualities, most notably Theosophy, in a way that demonstrates shifts in receptivity toward alternative spiritualities within work produced between 1986 and 2004.Design/methodology/approachMicrohistory, in combination with a Foucauldian genealogical history of the present approach, is used to carry out and contextualise a close reading of three historical works by Jill Roe on alternative spiritualities. Subtle shifts in positioning toward the subject are highlighted to point to larger shifts in receptivity toward the contemplative and alternative spiritualities.FindingsClose reading of three of Jill Roe\u2019s publications on alternative spiritualities in Australia and New Zealand are found to reveal shifts from a more cautious positioning toward the subject matter in earlier works to more open positionings in later works. These findings are rendered legible, it is argued, in the context of the contemporary acceptance of mindfulness, meditation and the emergence of a new cultural category of contemporary spirituality.Originality/valueThis paper responds to calls for the re-evaluation of the posture taken in the field of education history toward notions of meditation, mindfulness and alternative spiritualities. It has shown one way to respond to such calls which takes into account present framings of these subjects and applies a close, microhistory, reading of text. Creative examinations that draw together threads of connection are modelled through examining Jill Roe\u2019s work, particularly on Theosophy, to underscore continuities between Theosophy and Steiner education in Australia and New Zealand.",

      "abstract": "Educating graduate students about praxis represents a challenge and an opportunity. This essay explores an experience of learning praxis along with Transformative Phenomenology, the combination of which indicates a promising means for scaffolding graduate students to deeper self-reflection and changed thinking. The emergence of changed thinking is reasoned as a shift from subconscious thought processes to conscious ones. Contemplative practices drive the shift but require structured practice or engagement to achieve. The objective of such practice is internal clarity that manifests in mindful action that generates new understanding. The lived experience and examples outlined in this essay demonstrate how Transformative Phenomenology suits consciousness-raising and fosters more intentional praxis. Several techniques from phenomenology contribute to consciousness and warrant a brief discussion, including phenomenological reduction or bracketing, recognizing vantage points, and identifying motives and intentions. Additionally, we outline a process for exploring experiences intentionally through protocol writing. Teaching praxis along with Transformative Phenomenology contributes to the cultivation of aware social science graduate students who are self-reflective, conscious, and effective in their actions.\u00a0",

      "abstract": "The current literature for the various mental health professions is replete with studies demonstrating the critical importance of addressing spiritual and religious concerns in mental health treatment, yet many clinicians remain untrained in spiritual and religious competence. In recent years, researchers have developed training programs to support clinicians' understanding of how spirituality influences mental health and provided resources for how clinicians can address it with clients. The present study investigates the effectiveness of two online training programs, Spiritual Competency Training in Mental Health (SCT-MH) and a contemplative pedagogy-based program called Multicultural Orientation and Contemplative Awareness (MOCA), in enhancing spiritual and religious competence among counselors. We conducted a three-parallel-arm randomized controlled trial with a sample of practicing counselors to compare the SCT-MH (n = 10), MOCA (n = 15), and a wait-list control group (n = 29). We recruited our sample from state licensure boards for mental health practitioners, alumni listservs for counseling programs, and social media marketing. Additionally, the study examined the explanatory role of cultural humility on spiritual competence over time. Linear mixed modeling revealed a significant interaction between group and time, demonstrating that the SCT-MH group had a large effect and MOCA had a moderate effect in improving clinicians' total spiritual competence score compared with the control group. The findings suggest that both SCT-MH and MOCA can effectively enhance spiritual competence in counselors and cultural humility plays a significant role in this development. Implications and recommendations for implementation are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).",

      "abstract": "This Work-In-Progress Innovative Practice paper describes a pilot contemplative practice-based course and its impact on students' compassionate engagement from others, self-compassion, and mindfulness. Contemplative learning environments can foster compassion and empathy through invitational praxis, welcoming students' authentic selves, and engaging their diverse ways of knowing and being. A contemplative learning experience for 17 first-year engineering students was piloted in Fall 2024. Unlike traditional engineering education experiences, this course engaged students in first-person narratives while exploring theories of compassion and empathy and cultivating these qualities in intentional, meaningful, and applicable ways. The course's impact was assessed, in part, with scales for compassionate engagement from others, self-compassionate action, and mindfulness at the beginning, middle, and end of the semester. A repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) revealed statistically significant increases in compassionate engagement from others and mindfulness; however, the increase in self-compassionate action was not statistically significant. Despite varied individual student outcomes and mixed course evaluation feedback, our results demonstrate that a focus on compassion and empathy development while leveraging contemplative practices has the potential to foster compassionate engagement and mind-fulness in engineering students. This work highlights the impact of centering compassion and empathy in engineering learning environments and informs the integration of contemplative practices, including mindfulness, into engineering education.",

      "abstract": "Nondual awareness (NDA), a unified, unchanging state of consciousness devoid of other phenomenal contents, can be achieved by various means such as contemplative practices. NDA seems to have a beneficial effect on well-being. This study aimed to validate a French version of the Nondual Awareness Dimensional Assessment-Trait (NADA-T) scale used to measure predisposition to NDA in the context of mindfulness meditation, during experiences with reduced phenomenal content, referring to a marked decrease in usual mental activity. To do this, 294 French-speaking students anonymously completed an online survey to allow us to examine the construct validity, internal consistency, and convergent and discriminant validity of the French version of the NADA-T. They also provided information about their meditation practice or other experiences that led them to experience this state of non-duality. The original structure, with one global factor (NDA) and two specific factors (self-transcendence and bliss), showed very good statistical indicators. In addition, the results showed good convergent and discriminant validity. Recommendations to address some of the study\u2019s limitations included reformulating 2 items. However, although this preliminary French version of the NADA-T shows acceptable psychometric properties in a student population, further studies are needed to confirm the factor structure, test temporal stability, and extend these results to other populations. Plain Language Summary Measuring Nondual Awareness: Validating A French Version of The Assessment Some people describe a unique state of consciousness in which they experience a profound sense of oneness with all that exists. This state, known as nondual awareness (NDA), often occurs during mindfulness meditation or other practices that calm the mind. Research suggests that experiencing NDA can improve well-being. The aim of this study was to create and validate a French version of the Nondual Awareness Dimensional Assessment-Trait (NADA-T), a questionnaire used to measure a person's tendency to experience non-dual awareness. The researchers translated the NADA-T questionnaire into French and tested it with a group of French-speaking students practising mindfulness meditation. The French version of the NADA-T closely matched the original English structure. The results showed that the questionnaire was reliable (consistent in its measures) and had good validity (it measured what it was supposed to measure). This study provides a validated tool for future research into NDA in French-speaking populations. Understanding NDA could help researchers explore its effects on well-being and mental health. This assessment could also be useful to mindfulness practitioners, psychologists and neuroscientists studying altered states of consciousness.",

      "abstract": "The drive to find one unifying theory, one overarching universal principle that would subsume and explain all, has been a common theme of human striving for knowledge for many centuries. It reflects, perhaps, a deep intuition that within every experience there is such a unifying singular essence, present yet ordinarily hidden, which when discovered would restore one to the wholeness of authentic being. Indeed, as contemplative traditions tell us, that singular essence is consciousness itself, that which is, and has been, aware or conscious in all our experiences. This nondual awareness, free from mental representations and their constructs, appears uncaused by anything other than itself and remains, once realized, relatively unchanged in different experiences. So, metaphorically, it is without birth or death. While the current increase in our understanding of consciousness has been, in many respects, exponential, our understanding of nondual awareness appears still elusive and more like a slowly ascending spiral, where each generation makes their unique contributions while still making largely the same mistakes. Like nondual awareness itself, then, many issues in understanding and researching it seem to be eternal as well. Previously, I have introduced nondual awareness and discussed why its non-representational reflexivity makes it unique and distinct from perceptual, affective, and cognitive contents, from various global states both natural and altered, and from functions of consciousness like attention, memory, meta-cognition, etc. Here, I will sketch out some issues related to ontology, epistemics, participant reports, and experiment design.",

      "abstract": "Mind\u2013body practices such as meditation, yoga, and martial arts have been suggested to enhance flexible self-experience and psychological well-being. However, few studies have examined short-term effects of contemplative bodywork rooted in traditional martial arts on perception of self\u2013other boundaries and relevant psychological states. The present study employed a three-arm randomized controlled design to examine psychological effects of the Wakame Exercise, a paired body\u2013mind practice derived from a school of martial arts in Japan. Seventy undergraduates were randomly assigned to a 45 min session of wakame exercise (N = 25; 20 females, 5 males; M age = 19.4, SD = 0.64), a control practice, Push-Hand Sumo (N = 25; 15 females, 10 males; M age = 19.5, SD = 1.20), or rest (N = 20; 17 females, 3 males; M age = 19.4, SD = 1.09). Outcomes included nondual awareness, perceived body boundaries, creative attitudes, decentering, and positive/negative affect. The wakame exercise group showed significant increase in nondual awareness (p < 0.001, Cohen\u2019s d = \u22121.74) and decrease in the salience of perceived body boundaries (p < 0.001, Cohen\u2019s d = 1.25) following practice, which were more apparent than controls. Within the wakame exercise group, nondual awareness was significantly positively correlated with creative attitudes, and higher creative attitudes were associated with greater decentering following practice. These findings suggest that brief paired practices rooted in Eastern martial arts can promote nondual awareness and temporary boundary dissolution, potentially enhancing creativity (Approved by the Ethics Review Committee on Research with Human Subjects of Waseda University, No. 2022\u2013397).",

It draws them together on the basis of their shared affirmation that conscious states and operations are intrinsically and nontransitively self-aware. Consciousness as such, on this view, is this simple, nontransitive\u2014and so nondual\u2014self-awareness. Beyond this shared affirmation, both affirm that contemplative training includes heightening awareness of this nondual self-presence constitutive of consciousness as such. More than that, both describe a process of deepening awareness of this nondual self-presence: a contemplative passage from awareness of the relatively superficial nondual presence that renders ordinary intentional contents experientially available to awareness of a more profound nondual self-presence sensed as a limitless, primordial-most ground. Helminiak\u2019s account thus provides a basic understanding of consciousness, and with it a contemplative psychology and gnoseology, which can mediate further Christian theological reception of Tibetan Mah\u0101mudr\u0101 and other traditions where nondual awareness is central: it is both Christian-adjacent (connate with deep Christian trends) and also speaks in the terms of these Mah\u0101mudr\u0101 descriptions\u2014namely, a philosophy of mind and consciousness for which consciousness as such is nondual self-presence. Helminiak\u2019s account thus gives us a Christian-adjacent cognitional theory and gnoseology for which the kinds of contemplative development described by Mah\u0101mudr\u0101 make sense\u2014in other words, can be anticipated and to a significant but not total degree restated in the terms of a Christian-adjacent contemplative psychology.",

      "abstract": "Nondual awareness and nonduality have been discussed increasing in the psychological literature in the context of mindfulness-based interventions. Particularly later generations of such programs increasingly link mindfulness practice to spirituality or Buddhist philosophy. For that reason, terms related to nonduality, including nondualism and nondual awareness, are being discussed for a broader audience. Scientific communication requires clear definitions, and the purpose of this conceptual article is to clarify the differences between various terms related to nonduality. A commonly discussed type of awareness in meditation research is nondual awareness. While this involves dissolution of subject and object in a similar vein as nondualism, the latter is a philosophical framework. In addition to fostering nondual awareness states, long-term Buddhist practitioners also tend to develop a more trait-like awareness of nonduality, which is a way of relating to everyday experiences based on core spiritual insights.",

Self-awareness is defined as having an accurate understanding of one's personality, strengths, weaknesses, thoughts, beliefs, motivations, and emotions, as well as how one is perceived by others. The article outlines three key components of self-awareness - intrapersonal, interpersonal, and behavioral - and then delves into specific techniques leaders can use to enhance each aspect, including 360-degree feedback assessments, journaling, executive coaching, after-action reviews, and seeking diverse perspectives. Ultimately, the article argues that developing self-awareness is one of the most impactful investments a leader can make to strengthen both themselves and their organization, enabling them to make better decisions, foster stronger relationships, and bring out the best in those around them.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a critical global health threat, rendering common bacterial infections increasingly difficult to treat and placing considerable strain on healthcare systems. This study assesses public awareness, perceptions, and behaviors related to antibiotic use and AMR in Kosovo, a country with limited existing data on the topic. Methods: Using a cross-sectional survey design, 568 participants from diverse demographic backgrounds provided insights into their knowledge and practices concerning antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance. Results: The results revealed that although 75% of participants had heard of antibiotic resistance, only a limited proportion understood key terms. Knowledge of appropriate antibiotic use varied, with 67% of respondents correctly recognizing the need to complete a prescribed antibiotic course, while 29% believed it was acceptable to stop treatment once they felt better. Gender and educational level emerged as significant factors, with women and more educated individuals demonstrating greater awareness of proper antibiotic use and the risks of misuse. While 71% of respondents considered it unacceptable to use antibiotics prescribed to others, 41% believed it was acceptable to reuse previously effective antibiotics. Most participants (96%) reported obtaining antibiotics through prescriptions. Public awareness of AMR was generally high, but conceptual understanding remained limited, with misconceptions about the origins of resistance, incorrectly attributing it to the human body rather than bacteria. Conclusions: Targeted public health campaigns, guided by the One Health approach, integrating human, animal, and environmental health, are needed. A multifaceted strategy, including education, policy reforms, and international collaboration, is essential to mitigate AMR and preserve the efficacy of antibiotics for future generations.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nAn online survey was conducted to assess psychiatrists' familiarity with the metabolic syndrome and its components in patients with bipolar disorder, and characterize their perspectives and practices regarding its impact on patient management.\n\n\nMETHODS\nParticipants were US psychiatrists from a random sample of those in the AMA database. Qualified respondents practiced 4-30 years, spent > or = 50% of their time in direct patient care, and treated > or = 25 bipolar patients in the last month. Results were collected and tabulated by Harris Interactive from Nov-Dec 2005.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFive hundred psychiatrists qualified and completed the survey, and 50 respondents also participated in follow-up interviews. Most respondents (94%) viewed metabolic syndrome as a significant health risk requiring monitoring and treatment. While 76% have diagnosed it, only 28% correctly identified the five NCEP diagnostic criteria. Medication adverse effects of greatest concern were weight gain, glucose intolerance, and dyslipidemia. During treatment, 78% of respondents reported monitoring weight, 69% glucose, 61% lipids, and 52% blood pressure. Most respondents (92%) reported referring patients to specialists or primary care for metabolic abnormalities. Changes in metabolic profile were reported to prompt many psychiatrists (85%) to stop or switch bipolar medications, especially those who treat a large number of bipolar patients (89%). The follow-up interviews supported a change in practice patterns over the last 5 years.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNearly all respondents have metabolic concerns with medical therapies used to treat bipolar disorder. Many now routinely monitor weight and other metabolic parameters. Most have referred patients for medical management and adjusted bipolar therapies due to metabolic abnormalities.",

However, the absence of large-scale 3D vision-language datasets has posed a significant obstacle. To address this issue, typical approaches focus on injecting 3D awareness into 2D LMMs by designing 3D input-level scene representations. This work provides a new perspective. We introduce reconstructive visual instruction tuning with 3D-awareness (Ross3D), which integrates 3D-aware visual supervision into the training procedure. Specifically, it incorporates cross-view and global-view reconstruction. The former requires reconstructing masked views by aggregating overlapping information from other views. The latter aims to aggregate information from all available views to recover Bird's-Eye-View images, contributing to a comprehensive overview of the entire scene. Empirically, Ross3D achieves state-of-the-art performance across various 3D scene understanding benchmarks. More importantly, our semi-supervised experiments demonstrate significant potential in leveraging large amounts of unlabeled 3D vision-only data.",

However, these studies have overlooked outcome variables concerning employee interactions with customers, despite the prevalence of boundary-spanning roles in the hospitality industry, which involve frequent interactions between customers and hotel workers. Thus, according to cognitive appraisal theory and the job demands \u2013 resources model, our research addresses the literature gap by delving into the STARA awareness-proactive customer service performance relationship while considering the roles played by work engagement and employee resilience. Data from 554 matched pairs of hotel employees and supervisors revealed that viewing STARA awareness as a challenge fully mediated its connection with proactive customer service performance via work engagement, with employee resilience moderating this pathway. By contrast, a hindrance perception of STARA awareness had a direct and negative impact on proactive customer service performance.",

      "abstract": "Underwater Image Quality Assessment (UIQA) is currently an area of intensive research interest. Existing deep learning-based UIQA models always learn a deep neural network to directly map the input degraded underwater image into a final quality score via end-to-end training. However, a wide variety of image contents or distortion types may correspond to the same quality score, making it challenging to train such a deep model merely with a single subjective quality score as supervision. An intuitive idea to solve this problem is to exploit more detailed degradation-aware information as supplementary guidance to facilitate model learning. In this paper, we devise a novel deep UIQA model with Explicit Degradation Awareness embedding, i.e., EDANet. To train the EDANet, a two-stage training strategy is adopted. First, a tailored Degradation Information Discovery subnetwork (DIDNet) is pre-trained to infer a residual map between the input degraded underwater image and its pseudoreference counterpart. The inferred residual map explicitly characterizes the local degradation of the input underwater image. The intermediate feature representations on the decoder side of DIDNet are then embedded into the Degradation-guided Quality Evaluation subnetwork (DQENet), which significantly enhances the feature characterization capability with higher degradation awareness for quality prediction. The superiority of our EDANet against 18 state-of-the-art methods has been well demonstrated by extensive comparisons on two benchmark datasets.

      "abstract": "The growing demand for energy in developing societies, coupled with dwindling conventional resources, necessitates the adoption of renewable energy (RE) sources. A comprehensive understanding of these sources and their optimal utilization is crucial. The awareness of the users plays a very important role in the effective utilization of different energy sources. Hence, this study examines the level of RE awareness in Palestine, identifying factors influencing public perception and exploring potential strategies for promoting RE adoption. This awareness depends on different factors related to the users' education level, community type, and type of building. Different factors that affect the willingness and attitude to gain knowledge about RE are presented. In addition, various practices highlighting the increasing level of awareness regarding the adoption of RE sources are investigated. In addition, the status of RE education and its potential impact on engineers have also been discussed. Various individual and institutional efforts are highlighted in the study as strategies to bridge the gap and overcome obstacles to adopting RE sources. Suggestions for better use of these resources have been highlighted. Thereafter, recommendations for effective RE implementation in Palestine are analyzed and conclusions are drawn. The main challenges in integrating RE into Palestine's existing energy grid and system include infrastructure limitations, resources and financial constraints, and political issues. Still, there are possibilities in the form of international collaboration and investment. A flexible and modular RE grid could also address some of these challenges by integrating small\u2010scale systems that can be scaled up as needed.",

      "abstract": "Nursing students encounter significant academic and psychological challenges that can impede their transition from theoretical knowledge to practical application, affecting their well-being and professional development. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Reflective Mindfulness and Emotional Regulation Training (RMERT) in improving nursing students\u2019 self-awareness, understanding, and emotional regulation. This study employed a convergent parallel mixed-method randomized controlled trial design. Forty fourth-year undergraduate nursing students were randomly assigned using simple randomization (computer-generated random numbers) into either an intervention group (n\u2009=\u200920) or a control group (n\u2009=\u200920). The intervention group participated in a six-week RMERT program designed to enhance self-awareness, understanding, and emotional regulation. The control group continued with standard course activities. Quantitative data were collected pre- and post-intervention using the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), and analyzed using SPSS. Qualitative data, gathered exclusively from the intervention group through recorded reflective group sessions, were analyzed using thematic analysis. The intervention group exhibited significantly improved self-awareness, understanding, and emotional regulation compared to the control group. Additionally, students displayed an increased capacity for mindfulness, a decreased tendency to suppress emotions, and greater comfort in reflecting on positive and negative emotions. Integrating RMERT into nursing curricula may enhance nursing students\u2019 well-being and professional growth, mainly when counseling resources are limited. The program can improve self-awareness, understanding, and regulation skills necessary for effective nursing practice. Integrating RMERT into nursing curricula enhances self-awareness, emotional regulation, and reflective practice. This approach equips students with essential skills for managing clinical stress and building therapeutic relationships. As future nurses, they develop resilience, clinical reasoning, and empathetic patient care, ultimately elevating care quality and professional growth in diverse healthcare settings.

      "abstract": "Salient ship detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery plays a crucial role in maritime surveillance. However, traditional single-modal SAR methods are constrained by limited ship-relevant information and weak feature extraction robustness, which hinders detection performance. To address this issue, this correspondence proposes a long-term automatic identification system (AIS) data assisted frequency-spatial contextual awareness network, named AIS-FCANet, for salient ship detection in SAR imagery. This is the first attempt to incorporate ship distribution density information derived from long-term AIS data to enhance the feature representation of ships in SAR images. We incorporate the Segment Anything Model 2.1 (SAM2.1) as the backbone feature extractor, leveraging its capability to capture both fine-grained details and global context. To further optimize the input features, an adapter module is designed for SAM2.1, which utilizes a learnable prompting mechanism to dynamically refine feature representations, thereby significantly improving the robustness of ship feature extraction. Furthermore, to fully exploit the complementary characteristics of SAR and AIS data, a frequency-spatial domain context-aware fusion module is developed. This module enhances both frequency and spatial domain attention mechanisms to enhance multilevel feature fusion and facilitate cross-modal interaction. Experimental results show that AIS-FCANet outperforms existing methods, achieving significant improvements in both detection accuracy and robustness.",

      "abstract": "Background With the increasing rise of green consumption concepts, consumers are becoming more concerned with the health and environmental attributes of products. However, research on purchase intentions for green-packaged organic foods remains relatively limited, particularly regarding the specific impact of health consciousness and environmental awareness. There is a clear gap in the literature addressing these factors. Method Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), this study constructs a relationship model between health consciousness, environmental awareness, attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and purchase intentions for green-packaged organic foods. A total of 372 valid survey samples were collected, and data analysis was performed using SPSS 26.0 and AMOS 28.0 software to validate the theoretical model and research hypotheses. Results Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis reveals that all hypotheses are significantly supported, and the model demonstrates good fit. Mediation effect analysis further reveals the impact of health consciousness and environmental awareness on purchase intentions, indicating that they influence consumer intentions indirectly through attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Conclusion Health consciousness and environmental awareness not only significantly affect consumers\u2019 purchase intentions for green-packaged organic foods through direct paths but also have important indirect effects through attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. This study provides a new perspective for the theoretical development of green consumer behavior and offers valuable practical insights for businesses and policymakers in promoting green consumption and sustainable products.",

      "abstract": "Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) have a significant role in raising competences critical for addressing global sustainability challenges. However, a lack of sustainability awareness was observed among university students. This study examines students\u2019 awareness of sustainability and pro-environmental behaviors within a higher education institution in Jordan. It explores the role of educational institutions in fostering sustainability awareness and encouraging pro-environmental behaviors by integrating sustainable development goals into their curricula. The study employs a quantitative methodology, comprising primary data collected through a designed survey. The survey was answered by 503 students from the University of Jordan. The research adopted a combination of statistical methods for the analysis of the survey results, including t-tests, one-way ANOVA, and Tukey\u2019s post hoc test. A regression analysis of the survey results was performed to test the proposed hypotheses. The results reveal that while students have a moderate level of awareness, they display a high level of pro-environmental behavior. Furthermore, the study reveals that the inclusion of the 17 SDGs in the curriculum positively impacts students\u2019 awareness and influences sustainable behaviors. The results also suggest that student behavior at the University of Jordan is impacted by gender, age, and academic year, while awareness remains consistent. The study concluded that the University of Jordan is geared to enhance the students\u2019 understanding of SDGs and their pro-environmental behavior. The study recommends targeted curriculum enhancements to increase students\u2019 awareness and drive behavioral changes. The importance of this study lies in the exploration of education for sustainability in higher education institutions within developing countries, where research on this topic is limited.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThis study evaluated recent trends in hypertension prevalence and management among US young adults, and assessed disparities by age, sex, or race and ethnicity, as well as potential factors contributing to the age-related disparities.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData from 51,291 adults aged \u226518 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2004 to 2021-2023 were analyzed. Stage 1 or 2 hypertension was defined as systolic/diastolic blood pressure (BP) \u2265130/80 mmHg or antihypertensive medication use. Hypertension awareness and treatment were based on self-report.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn 2021-2023, 21.3% (20.4 million) young adults aged 18-39 years had stage 1 or 2 hypertension, of whom only 28.3% were aware of their condition and 5.6% achieved BP control to <130/80\u00a0mm Hg. While hypertension prevalence among young adults remained stable from 2003-2004 to 2021-2023, awareness and control declined after 2013-2014, though no apparent change in control rates was observed between 2017-2020 and 2021-2023. Compared to adults aged \u226540 years, young adults had lower rates of awareness, treatment, and control, with lower rates of having a routine place for healthcare explaining 7%-16% of the gaps. Disparities in hypertension awareness, treatment, and control were greatest among young adult men, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic individuals compared with other sex and racial and ethnic subgroups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn 2021-2023, one in five US young adults had hypertension, yet awareness and control have declined since 2013-2014 and remain low.",

      "abstract": "Multi-Agent collaborative perception enhances perceptual capabilities by utilizing information from multiple agents and is considered a fundamental solution to the problem of weak single-vehicle perception in autonomous driving. However, existing collaborative perception methods face a dilemma between communication efficiency and perception accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a novel communication-efficient collaborative perception framework based on supply-demand awareness and intermediate-late hybridization, dubbed as CoSDH. By modeling the supply-demand relationship between agents, the framework refines the selection of collaboration regions, reducing unnecessary communication cost while maintaining accuracy. In addition, we innovatively introduce the intermediate-late hybrid collaboration mode, where late-stage collaboration compensates for the performance degradation in collaborative perception under low communication bandwidth. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, including both simulated and real-world scenarios, demonstrate that CoSDH achieves state-of- the-art detection accuracy and optimal bandwidth tradeoffs, delivering superior detection precision under real communication bandwidths, thus proving its effectiveness and practical applicability.

      "abstract": "Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at identifying and describing objects but often fail at spatial reasoning. We study why VLMs, such as LLaVA, underutilize spatial cues despite having positional encodings and spatially rich vision encoder features. Our analysis reveals a key imbalance: vision token embeddings have much larger norms than text tokens, suppressing LLM's position embedding. To expose this mechanism, we developed three interpretability tools: (1) the Position Sensitivity Index, which quantifies reliance on token order, (2) the Cross Modality Balance, which reveals attention head allocation patterns, and (3) a RoPE Sensitivity probe, which measures dependence on rotary positional embeddings. These tools uncover that vision tokens and system prompts dominate attention. We validated our mechanistic understanding through targeted interventions that predictably restore positional sensitivity. These findings reveal previously unknown failure modes in multimodal attention and demonstrate how interpretability analysis can guide principled improvements.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE\nThe primary purpose of the study was to explore the impact of health workers' awareness of artificial intelligence (AI) on their workplace well-being, addressing a critical gap in the literature. By examining this relationship through the lens of the Job demands-resources (JD-R) model, the study aimed to provide insights into how health workers' perceptions of AI integration in their jobs and careers could influence their informal learning behaviour and, consequently, their overall well-being in the workplace. The study's findings could inform strategies for supporting healthcare workers during technological transformations.\n\n\nDESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH\nThe study employed a quantitative research design using a survey methodology to collect data from 420 health workers across 10 hospitals in Ghana that have adopted AI technologies. The study was analysed using OLS and structural equation modelling.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nThe study findings revealed that health workers' AI awareness positively impacts their informal learning behaviour at the workplace. Again, informal learning behaviour positively impacts health workers' workplace well-being. Moreover, informal learning behaviour mediates the relationship between health workers' AI awareness and workplace wellbeing. Furthermore, employee learning orientation was found to strengthen the effect of AI awareness on informal learning behaviour.\n\n\nRESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS\nWhile the study provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge its limitations. The study was conducted in a specific context (Ghanaian hospitals adopting AI), which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other healthcare settings or industries. Self-reported data from the questionnaires may be subject to response biases, and the study did not account for potential confounding factors that could influence the relationships between the variables.\n\n\nPRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS\nThe study offers practical implications for healthcare organizations navigating the digital transformation era. By understanding the positive impact of health workers' AI awareness on their informal learning behaviour and well-being, organizations can prioritize initiatives that foster a learning-oriented culture and provide opportunities for informal learning. This could include implementing mentorship programs, encouraging knowledge-sharing among employees and offering training and development resources to help workers adapt to AI-driven changes. Additionally, the findings highlight the importance of promoting employee learning orientation, which can enhance the effectiveness of such initiatives.\n\n\nORIGINALITY/VALUE\nThe study contributes to the existing literature by addressing a relatively unexplored area - the impact of AI awareness on healthcare workers' well-being. While previous research has focused on the potential job displacement effects of AI, this study takes a unique perspective by examining how health workers' perceptions of AI integration can shape their informal learning behaviour and, subsequently, their workplace well-being. By drawing on the JD-R model and incorporating employee learning orientation as a moderator, the study offers a novel theoretical framework for understanding the implications of AI adoption in healthcare organizations.",

      "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated the plausibility of frontier AI models scheming -- knowingly and covertly pursuing an objective misaligned with its developer's intentions. Such behavior could be very hard to detect, and if present in future advanced systems, could pose severe loss of control risk. It is therefore important for AI developers to rule out harm from scheming prior to model deployment. In this paper, we present a suite of scheming reasoning evaluations measuring two types of reasoning capabilities that we believe are prerequisites for successful scheming: First, we propose five evaluations of ability to reason about and circumvent oversight (stealth). Second, we present eleven evaluations for measuring a model's ability to instrumentally reason about itself, its environment and its deployment (situational awareness). We demonstrate how these evaluations can be used as part of a scheming inability safety case: a model that does not succeed on these evaluations is almost certainly incapable of causing severe harm via scheming in real deployment. We run our evaluations on current frontier models and find that none of them show concerning levels of either situational awareness or stealth.",

      "abstract": "The integration of Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) into healthcare is rapidly evolving, necessitating ethical preparedness among nursing students. GAI technologies present ethical challenges related to patient privacy, algorithmic bias, and informed consent, underscoring the need for structured AI ethics education in nursing curricula. This study aims to examine the impact of an ethics education program on nursing students\u2019 AI ethical awareness, moral sensitivity, attitudes, and intentions to use GAI in healthcare. A quasi experimental, pretest\u2012posttest study was conducted with 115 nursing students. The participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n\u2009=\u200957), which received a structured AI ethics education program, or a control group (n\u2009=\u200958), which did not receive the intervention. The validated scales measured AI ethical awareness, moral sensitivity, attitudes, and the intention to use AI before and after the intervention. Compared with the control group, the intervention group demonstrated a significant increase in AI ethical awareness (M\u2009=\u200957.28, SD\u2009=\u200922.28) (M\u2009=\u200947.43, SD\u2009=\u200924.04; p\u2009=\u2009.025, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.044). Moral sensitivity also showed a notable improvement in the intervention group (M\u2009=\u200974.33, SD\u2009=\u200929.93) compared with the control group (M\u2009=\u200960.26, SD\u2009=\u200922.52; p\u2009=\u2009.005, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.067). Compared with the control group, positive attitudes toward AI significantly increased postintervention (M\u2009=\u200939.46, SD\u2009=\u200911.51) (M\u2009=\u200923.21, SD\u2009=\u200911.72; p\u2009<\u2009.001, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.332), indicating a strong effect of ethics education. Furthermore, the intention to use AI technology improved significantly in the intervention group (M\u2009=\u200912.46, SD\u2009=\u20093.55) compared with the control group (M\u2009=\u200910.24, SD\u2009=\u20093.15; p\u2009=\u2009.001, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.099). However, negative attitudes toward GAI did not significantly change postintervention. This study highlights the effectiveness of structured AI ethics education in enhancing ethical competencies among nursing students. Integrating such programs into nursing curricula is essential to prepare future nurses for ethical decision-making in AI-driven healthcare. These findings support the development of standardized ethics training modules to guide responsible AI use in clinical practice and inform future curriculum design. Not applicable.",

      "abstract": "Healthcare professionals face high levels of stress, which negatively impacts their mental health, well-being, and job performance. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is an intervention designed to mitigate stress and promote emotional well-being, but its long-term effects in healthcare settings remain under-explored. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of MBSR in reducing stress, improving mental health, and alleviating burnout among healthcare workers. A systematic literature review was conducted, synthesizing findings from peer-reviewed articles published within the past decade. Key criteria for study selection included the focus on MBSR's impact on healthcare workers' stress levels, mental health, and burnout. The results demonstrated that MBSR significantly reduced perceived stress, emotional exhaustion, and burnout, while improving emotional regulation, self-compassion, and overall mental health. However, a gap in the literature exists regarding the long-term benefits of MBSR, particularly its sustainability and effectiveness in diverse healthcare settings. The study highlights that while MBSR is an effective short-term intervention, further research is needed to explore its long-term feasibility and generalizability. The findings emphasize the importance of integrating MBSR into healthcare settings to support healthcare professionals' mental well-being and resilience, thereby improving the quality of care and fostering healthier work environments.",

Nursing school is an ideal time to implement EBI to mitigate burnout and increase resilience in pre\u2010professional populations. Aim The current study tested whether Mindfulness\u2010Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) significantly improved stress, burnout, and wellness in a university\u2010based nursing school. Methods Using a non\u2010randomized clinical trial design, multilevel modeling for repeated measures tested intervention effects over time in MBSR participants (n\u2009=\u200973) and matched controls (n\u2009=\u200973), as well as potential moderation of intervention effects by modality (online vs. in\u2010person MBSR) and subpopulation (students vs. faculty/staff). Results MBSR effectively reduced perceived stress, exhaustion, and total burnout and increased positive affect and frequency of using two key mindfulness skills: observing and nonreactivity. No significant effects of the intervention were observed for disengagement from work, satisfaction with life, negative affect, or the mindfulness skills of describing, acting with awareness, and nonjudgment. Effects were similar across modality and subpopulation. Linking Evidence to Action MBSR increases stress resilience and can be delivered effectively online and in person. Moreover, MBSR appears equally impactful for nursing students and faculty/staff. Implications for integrating EBI into schools of nursing to improve well\u2010being are discussed.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: Data on the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) positive psychological traits and experiential avoidance (EA) among cancer patients are lacking. Objective: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to: (1) compare the efficacy between MBSR and treatment-as-usual (TAU) control groups in increasing posttraumatic growth (PTG), hope, and optimism and reducing EA across time measurements (T0, T1, and T2) among head and neck cancer (HNC) patients and (2) evaluate the mediation effects of hope, optimism, and EA on the relationship between MBSR and PTG. Methods: A total of 80 HNC participants were randomized to MBSR (n\u2009=\u200940) and TAU (n\u2009=\u200940) groups with the researchers and data analyst blinded, and the group allocation of the participants was concealed. A one-hour MBSR session was conducted once a week, with 45 minutes of home assignments, for six weeks in the MBSR group. The outcomes across time measurements were compared using a mixed linear model following intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Mediation effects of hope, optimism, and EA on the relationship between MBSR and PTG were assessed with PROCESS. Results: MBSR significantly increased the degree of optimism from T0 to T1 (mean difference\u2009=\u20091.825, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.907\u20132.743, SE\u2009=\u20090.381, p\u2009<\u2009.001) with a medium effect size (d\u2009=\u20090.563) and from T1 to T2 (mean difference\u2009=\u20091.650, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.829\u20132.470, SE\u2009=\u20090.328, p\u2009<\u2009.001) with a medium effect size (d\u2009=\u20090.630). Initially, MBSR did not increase the degree of hope from T0 to T1 (p\u2009=\u2009.677), but it significantly increased hope from T1 to T2 (mean difference\u2009=\u20092.524, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.676\u20133.373, SE\u2009=\u20090.340, p\u2009<\u2009.001) with a medium effect size (d\u2009=\u20090.735). Conversely, MBSR did not sustain the changes in the degree of PTG and EA beyond T1. EA partially mediated the relationship between MBSR and PTG, but not hope and optimism. Conclusion: MBSR can be recommended as part of the treatment regimen for HNC patients. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04800419. HIGHLIGHTS Mindfulness-based stress reduction enhanced optimism and hope in cancer. Mindfulness-based stress reduction does not sustain posttraumatic growth and experiential avoidance in cancer. 6 weeks of mindfulness-based stress reduction enhanced positive psychological traits in cancer.",

      "abstract": "Objective This clinical trial sought to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of psilocybin and MBSR for frontline healthcare providers with symptoms of depression and burnout related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This was a randomized controlled trial that enrolled physicians and nurses with frontline clinical work during the COVID-19 pandemic and symptoms of depression and burnout. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either an 8-week MBSR curriculum alone or an 8-week MBSR curriculum plus group psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy (PAP) with 25mg psilocybin. Symptoms of depression and burnout were assessed at baseline, and 2-weeks and 6-months post intervention utilizing the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR-16) and Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey for Medical Professionals (MBI-HSS-MP), respectively. Secondary outcome measures included the Demoralization Scale (DS-II) and the Watts Connectedness Scale (WCS). Adverse events and suicidality were assessed through 6-month follow-up. Results 25 participants were enrolled and randomized. There were 12 study-related AEs recorded that were Grade 1-2 and no serious AEs. There was larger decrease in QIDS score for the MBSR+PAP arm compared to MBSR-only from baseline to 2-weeks post-intervention and significant between-group differences favoring MBSR+PAP on subscales of the MBI-HSS-MP as well as the DS-II and WCS. Conclusions Group psilocybin-assisted therapy plus MBSR was associated with clinically significant improvement in depressive symptoms without serious adverse events and with greater reduction in symptoms than MBSR alone. Study findings suggest that integrating psilocybin with mindfulness training may represent a promising treatment for depression and burnout among physicians and nurses.",

      "abstract": "Objective This study applies the Dual-Factor Model of Mental Health to examine the effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) among college students, addressing a critical gap in understanding how mindfulness interventions simultaneously promote positive mental health and reduce psychological distress. Sleep quality was investigated as a potential mediating mechanism, and the scalability of MBSR as a campus-wide intervention was explored in the post-pandemic context, where student mental health concerns have risen sharply. Method A sequential quantitative design was employed, combining cross-sectional analysis (N\u202f=\u202f406) and a randomized controlled trial (N\u202f=\u202f120). In the cross-sectional phase, mindfulness (MAAS), sleep quality (Athens Insomnia Scale), psychological distress (DASS-21), and positive mental health (MHC-SF) were assessed. Path analysis and bootstrap-based mediation testing (5,000 resamples) were used to examine structural relationships and estimate indirect effects, particularly the mediating role of sleep quality. In the experimental phase, participants were randomly assigned to an 8-week MBSR program or a waitlist control group, with assessments at baseline, post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up to evaluate sustained outcomes. We employed sequential quantitative design combining cross-sectional analysis (N\u202f=\u202f406) and a randomized controlled trial (N\u202f=\u202f120). The cross-sectional phase used the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), and Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF) to establish structural relationships through path analysis and bootstrap-based mediation testing (5,000 resamples). The intervention phase randomly assigned participants to an 8-week MBSR program or waitlist control, with assessments at baseline, post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up to capture sustainability. Result Cross-sectional analyses revealed that mindfulness was positively associated with positive mental health (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.38, p\u202f<\u202f0.01) and negatively associated with psychological distress (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.31, p\u202f<\u202f0.01). Sleep quality emerged as a potential mediator, particularly in relation to positive mental health outcomes. The intervention group demonstrated robust and sustained improvements in positive mental health (d\u202f=\u202f0.71, 95% CI [0.52, 0.90]). Psychological distress showed more variable patterns, with no significant between-group differences observed.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a modified Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) intervention on stress and fatigue in patients undergoing hemodialysis. The study adopted a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest control group design and employed simple random sampling. A total of 32 respondents participated, with 16 in each group. Stress was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and fatigue using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F 40). The modified MBSR intervention was conducted for 30 minutes per session. Data were analyzed using paired t-tests and independent t-tests. The results showed significant differences in stress (MD = -13.12, t = -4.748, p < 0.001) and fatigue levels (MD = 7.34, t = -3.865, p = 0.001) between the intervention and control groups. These findings indicate that the modified MBSR therapy was effective in reducing stress and fatigue, with a p-value < 0.05 indicating statistical significance. Therefore, this modified MBSR therapy is a promising non-pharmacological nursing intervention that can be integrated into nursing care for chronic kidney failure patients experiencing stress and fatigue during hemodialysis.",

      "abstract": "Emotional regulation is an important aspect in maintaining the mental health of the elderly, especially those suffering from chronic diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Chronic disease conditions often trigger psychological stress that impacts an individual's ability to manage emotions. One of the non-pharmacological interventions widely developed to overcome stress is Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). This study aims to determine the effect of MBSR on emotional regulation in elderly with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Bangun Rejo Village in 2025. This study used a quantitative design with a one-group pretest\u2013posttest method. The study subjects were 30 elderly with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus selected using a total sampling technique. The MBSR intervention was given for eight sessions, and emotional regulation was measured using the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) before and after the intervention. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics and the Paired Sample t-Test. The results showed a significant increase in emotional regulation scores, from an average of 34.67 before the intervention to 75.50 after the MBSR intervention. Statistical test results showed a significant difference between pretest and posttest scores (p < 0.05). Thus, MBSR has been proven effective in improving emotional regulation in elderly people with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. The MBSR program is recommended as a supporting intervention in elderly health services.",

      "abstract": "Body awareness is considered to be an important element of mindfulness-based interventions. Although studies have been done on the effects of enhanced body awareness on health and well-being, none of these studies focused on the meaning of the body and body awareness in the teaching and learning process of enhancing one\u2019s body awareness. In this paper, we provide a phenomenology of the body in the practice of a mindfulness-based intervention. We present a participant observation study about an eight-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) training. We analyzed, by taking a hermeneutic-phenomenological approach, what enhancing one\u2019s body awareness entails in this practice, and how participants experienced their bodies in this process. We identified four ways in which the body (not) appears in MBSR: as intermittently present, as fragmented, while \u2018feeling good\u2019, and while \u2018not feeling good\u2019. We discussed how these body appearances can be understood through the analytic lens of Leder\u2019s disappearance and dys-appearance, and Zeiler\u2019s eu-appearance, and with Van Manen\u2019s phenomenological distinctions of the body. At the end of this paper, we considered how our findings may cast new light on one of the central tenets in mindfulness practice: to be non-judgmentally aware in the present moment.",

A desk study research design is commonly known as secondary data collection. This is basically collecting data from existing resources preferably because of its low cost advantage as compared to a field research. Our current study looked into already published studies and reports as the data was easily accessed through online journals and libraries. \nFindings: Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) effectively reduces blood pressure by managing stress and enhancing relaxation. Studies show significant reductions in systolic and diastolic pressure, particularly in individuals with resistant hypertension. MBSR programs are most beneficial when tailored to cultural contexts and when participants maintain consistent practice. It serves as a valuable, non-pharmacological complement to traditional hypertension treatments, improving overall well-being and long-term health outcomes. \nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: Biofeedback theory, cognitive behavioral theory (CBT) & transactional model of stress and coping may be used to anchor future studies on the effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in managing hypertension among adults. It emphasizes the importance of addressing both mental and physical health, providing a complementary treatment to traditional medical interventions such as medication. As a non-drug treatment, MBSR can reduce reliance on expensive medications, offering a more affordable alternative for long-term hypertension management.",

Namun, efektivitasnya dalam konteks pasien bipolar, khususnya yang diberikan oleh perawat, memerlukan perhatian khusus. Tujuan: Menilai efektivitas MBSR yang diterapkan oleh perawat dalam mengurangi emosi negatif pada pasien bipolar melalui meta-analisis. Metode: Penelitian ini menggunakan pendekatan systematic literature review dengan mengikut pedoman PRISMA(Preferred Reporting Items For Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Melakukan pencarian sistematis melalui basis data elektronik untuk studi yang memenuhi kriteria inklusi. Data dari studi yang memenuhi kriteria dianalisis menggunakan model efek acak, pencarian dilakukan untuk artikel Berbahasa Inggris dan Bahasa Indonesia yang terbit antara tahun 2013-2024. Hasil: MBSR yang diterapkan oleh perawat menunjukkan penurunan signifikan pada gejala depresi dan kecemasan pada pasien bipolar. Namun, efek pada gejala manik tidak signifikan. Efek positif lebih jelas terlihat dalam analisis dalam kelompok dibandingkan antara kelompok. Kesimpulan: MBSR yang diterapkan oleh perawat efektif dalam mengurangi emosi negatif pada pasien bipolar, terutama gejala depresi dan kecemasan. Namun, diperlukan penelitian lebih lanjut untuk memahami mekanisme dan durabilitas efeknya. \n\u00a0",

      "abstract": "Burnout is a significant concern among Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapists due to the emotionally demanding nature of their work with individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) in reducing burnout and enhancing mindfulness among ABA therapists in Pakistan. A quantitative pre-post design was used, involving 12 ABA therapists who participated in an eight-week MBSR program. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) were administered before and after the intervention. Results indicated significant reductions in overall burnout, particularly in emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, while personal accomplishment scores increased post-intervention. Likewise, mindfulness scores improved significantly across all five subscales. Correlational analysis revealed a strong negative association between mindfulness and burnout components, suggesting that higher mindfulness was linked with lower emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, and greater personal accomplishment. Additionally, therapists with fewer years of experience, younger age, and longer working hours reported higher burnout levels. These findings highlight the potential of MBSR as a practical and accessible tool to enhance emotional regulation, resilience, and professional sustainability in high-stress therapeutic settings. Limitations include small sample size and lack of follow-up data. Future research should explore long-term effects and use larger, more diverse samples.",

      "abstract": "This paper reviews and examines the effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) interventions in enhancing mindfulness and mitigating stress-related symptoms. Drawing on trial data from 13 selected studies involving 574 generally healthy adults, this research seeks to establish a robust correlation between heightened mindfulness and reduced perceived stress. We assessed mindfulness using the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) and measured stress reductions through self-reported questionnaires. Normalized effectiveness scores, calculated as percentages from pre-intervention baselines, enabled linear regression analyses. To ensure the integrity of our findings, we rigorously controlled for external influences by isolating MBSR as the exclusive intervention and MAAS as the sole mindfulness measurement. Aggregate data confirm positive outcomes: mindfulness improvements ranged from 3.77% to 26.80%, and stress reductions varied from 8.41% to 49.05%. Linear regression trendlines reveal a strong positive correlation between increased mindfulness and decreased perceived stress. This highlights the profound benefits of MBSR interventions in enhancing mental well-being and suggests their potential for widespread integration into mental health initiatives. Ultimately, this article not only underscores MBSR's role in promoting mental wellbeing but also offers a quantitative framework for predicting health outcomes based on mindfulness levels.\u00a0",

      "abstract": "Purpose\nSexual minority men (SMM) living with HIV experience significant mental health disparities. Studies show positive psychological interventions (PPI) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) can have a positive impact on people LWH, however, limited research has explored this among SMM LWH. The current study explores two MBIs (MBSR and yoga) as potential adjuncts to an app-based PPI, which was designed to reduce stress for SMM LWH.\n\n\nMethods\nThese data are from a sub-study of a proof-of-concept pilot. The pilot enrolled 22 SMM LWH, who used an app-based PPI for 90 days. Following completion of this initial study, participants were invited to participate in a focus group discussion, which explored SMM LWH's interest in MBSR vs. restorative yoga as adjunct programs to the app-based PPI.\n\n\nResults\nA third of participants from the initial study attended the focus group (N=7). All focus group participants were racial minorities (71.4% Black, 14.3% Hispanic/Latino, 14.3% Multiracial), with an average age of 32.14yrs (SD=4.87). When asked about initial interest, most participants said they would prefer restorative yoga over MBSR. In the discussion that followed, three main themes and eleven subthemes emerged, which elucidated SMM LWH's attitudes toward MBI, as well as their perceived barriers and facilitators for both yoga and MBSR.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe study provides insight into racial minority SMM LWH's comparative interest in two MBIs and suggests that yoga may be a feasible adjunct to the app-based PPI. However, inequities regarding access to yoga remain an important issue for SMM LWH and must be addressed.",

      "abstract": "Parents of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often experience high levels of parental stress. This has exacerbated during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) programme in the Chinese population, which is feasible among Chinese parents during the COVID-19 pandemic period in reducing the parental stress of parents compared with the usual care group. This study was designed as a pilot randomized controlled trial with single-blind repeated measures. Parents of children aged 3\u201312 years with a diagnosis of ADHD were recruited from the parent resource center (PRC) of a local nongovernmental organization between June and August 2022. The participants were randomly assigned to the MBSR intervention group (n\u2009=\u200918) or usual care group (n\u2009=\u200918). With respect to the feasibility of the study, all 36 participants who were randomized fully completed the MBSR programme and assessments, resulting in a 100% attendance rate. 66% of the participants in the intervention group reported satisfaction with the intervention, which was helpful in reducing stress. They were willing to stay on this mindfulness-based programme in the future. The results of the repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant difference in self-perceived stress reduction between the groups (p\u2009<\u20090.001, ES\u2009=\u20090.192). The of within-group results revealed that the mean score of the intervention group decreased from 29.44 before the intervention to 25.50 (p\u2009<\u20090.001) immediately after intervention, and further decreased to 24.72 (p\u2009<\u20090.05) at one month after the intervention. By using the parental stress scale, the interaction effects also revealed significant differences between groups (p\u2009<\u20090.001, ES\u2009=\u20090.599). The stress level of the intervention group decreased from 74.50 before intervention, to 68.94 (p\u2009<\u20090.001) immediately after intervention, and further decreased to 67.50 (p\u2009<\u20090.05) at one month after intervention. These reports revealed statistically significant improvements in stress reduction and parental stress reduction in the intervention group. The pilot study revealed that MBSR is feasible and acceptable for parents of children with ADHD in Chinese culture. The findings also suggested that the MBSR programme was effective in reducing parental stress and enhancing mental well-being. This study was registered in the National Library of Medicine, National Center for Biotechnology Information Clinical Trials Registry as Version 1, and the trial registration data are available as NCT06210113, 28/2/2024.",

Methods: Ninety patients with lumbar disc herniation who underwent radiofrequency ablation (RFA) combined with ozone interventional therapy in the Orthopedics and Traumatology Department of our hospital from January to December 2019 were included as research samples. They were randomly divided into two groups using a random number table method: the control group (45 cases) received routine perioperative nursing and health education; the experimental group (45 cases) received a comprehensive psychological intervention program consisting of MBSR combined with relaxation training in addition to the control group's treatment. Changes in pain perception (VAS), sleep quality (PSQI), psychological state (SAS/SDS), and life satisfaction (SWLS) were compared between the two groups before and after the intervention. Results: After the intervention, both groups showed a significant decrease in SAS and SDS scores (P<0.05), with a greater decrease in the experimental group (P<0.05); the experimental group had lower PSQI total scores and scores in each dimension compared to the control group (P<0.05); the experimental group had a significantly lower VAS score (3.56\u00b10.88) compared to the control group (5.94\u00b10.62) (P<0.05); the experimental group had a higher SWLS score (28.59\u00b15.61) compared to the control group (22.46\u00b14.15) (P<0.05). Conclusion: MBSR combined with relaxation training can significantly optimize the perioperative psychological state of patients undergoing RFA combined with ozone interventional therapy, reduce pain sensitivity and stress responses, and simultaneously improve sleep quality and treatment satisfaction.",

Now under the new fertility policy, the number of pediatric patients will increase. Pediatric nurses due to the particularity of the profession and the influence of various factors, in the face of heavy work, all day in a state of tension and anxiety, psychological bear a lot of mental and psychological pressure, long-term, so that nurses are physically and mentally tired, lose confidence in nursing work.\nIn this study, questionnaire survey and statistical analysis were used to analyze whether MBSR could relieve the stress of emergency department nurses. Mindfully based stress reduction therapy (MBSR) is a systematic meditation training method, which can effectively reduce individual stress, strengthen emotional management, and improve individual physical and mental adjustment ability. Whether mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy can improve the work stress of pediatric emergency nurses, thereby improving nursing ability and ensuring the quality and safety of clinical care.\nBased on the results of the collected data, pediatric emergency nurses were generally overstressed, while the system underwent MBSR and stress levels were measured to decrease. Pediatric emergency nurses often face trauma and high workloads. Mindfulness-based stress reduction programs have been studied as a potential holistic intervention to reduce stress in nurses by cultivating present-moment awareness, emotional regulation, and positive thinking.",

Methods/Study Population: Pharmacists in independently owned community pharmacies and patients \u226518 treated for chronic pain in the past year in rural Alabama were recruited via purposive and snowball sampling. One-hour virtual semi-structured interviews were conducted by Marketry, a qualitative market research company. Interview questions were guided by the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR) and focused on 1) knowledge/awareness; 2) attitudes; 3) barriers/facilitators (e.g., demand, reimbursement); 4) pharmacies\u2019 organizational readiness (e.g., technology, personnel, and culture); and 5) program preferences (content, format) regarding a potential pharmacy-based MBSR program for chronic pain management. Interview transcripts were analyzed using deductive content analysis to identify themes. Results/Anticipated Results: A total of 60 interviews were conducted (n = 30 pharmacists, n = 30 patients). Qualitative data analysis is ongoing and is expected to be completed by December 2024. Interviewee\u2019s responses describing knowledge, attitudes, barriers, facilitators, pharmacies\u2019 organizational readiness, and recommended program elements will be categorized according to the CFIR domains of \u201cinner setting,\u201d \u201couter setting,\u201d \u201cintervention characteristics,\u201d and \u201ccharacteristics of individuals.\u201d Domains will be summarized with over-arching themes.

      "abstract": "Background Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has been shown to be beneficial for adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but little is known about its use in pediatric IBD. Objective This pilot study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an MBSR program delivered by live-video during the COVID-19 pandemic for youth with IBD. Methods Four cohorts of an 8-session MBSR program were conducted via a HIPAA-compliant, video-conferencing platform from winter 2021 to spring 2022. Mixed-methods data were collected through semi-structured focus groups, study-specific surveys, attendance data, and self-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measures. Results Forty-six participants enrolled across 4 cohorts. Participants were 64% female, Mage=14.1 years, 36% non-Latinx White; most had Crohn\u2019s disease (81%). Participants attended an average of 7.6 of 8 classes, with 69% attending all 8 classes. Majority of participants (77%) were satisfied or very satisfied with the program. Three themes emerged from the focus groups (n=27): (1) IBD-specific benefits: reduced stress (which some identified as an IBD trigger) and connecting with IBD peers; (2) mental health benefits; and (3) virtual MBSR was feasible and well-liked, but challenges were present. Pre- vs post-program data (n = 30) showed statistically significant improvements in HRQOL (P = 0.04), HRQOL social functioning (P = 0.03), and perceived stress (P < 0.01). Conclusion This pilot study of live-video MBSR for youth with IBD shows feasibility and acceptability, high rates of attendance and satisfaction, and potential benefits in quality of life and stress. MBSR is a potential adjunctive therapy in pediatric IBD.",

The inability to manage emotions can interfere with students' concentration and academic development. This community service activity aims to improve teachers' competence in managing stress and anxiety through integrative counseling based on Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and muhasabah, with the hope that teachers will be able to apply these techniques both for themselves and to assist their students. The participants were 25 teachers from partner schools in the border region. The workshop was conducted face-to-face through theory and practice sessions, supplemented by group discussions. To assess the impact of the activity, participants filled out instruments before and after the training and wrote reflections. The results showed an increase in teachers' understanding, with 65% in the high category, 25% in the medium category, and 10% in the low category. Although an increase in teacher competence was evident, the limitation of this activity was the lack of long-term data on direct application to students and the sustainability of the practice in schools. Therefore, follow-up through continuous mentoring is necessary so that the benefits of this program can be felt more widely.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety is a widespread mental health concern that significantly impacts daily functioning and overall well-being for a portion of the overall population. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) has sparked interest as a therapeutic approach integrating mindfulness meditation and yoga to promote self-awareness, emotional regulation, and stress resilience. This literature review examines the relationship between MBSR and anxiety, exploring the mechanisms through which mindfulness practices alleviate anxiety symptoms. Research indicates that MBSR is as effective as pharmacological treatments and other behavioral therapies in reducing anxiety. Furthermore, MBSR has been successfully implemented across diverse populations, including individuals with chronic illness, veterans, college students, and women facing hormonal changes. However, accessibility barriers, cultural influences, and individual hesitations limit its reach and effectiveness. Studies suggest that modifying MBSR\u2019s structure, integrating it with complementary therapies, and expanding virtual platforms can enhance its impact. While MBSR provides significant benefits, its effectiveness depends on individual engagement and the availability of mental health resources. Future research should focus on long-term outcomes, optimizing accessibility, and further exploring the integration of MBSR with other evidence-based treatments to provide comprehensive anxiety management solutions.",

      "abstract": "Background: Stress is defined as a state of being pressured, both physically and psychologically. Stress experienced by mothers in raising children with special needs is called parenting stress. Mothers experience stress during the parenting process. Therefore, it is important to implement appropriate interventions. One form of intervention that can reduce stress is Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction. Objectives: This study aims to examine the impact of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) on the stress of mothers of children with special needs (CWSN) at the Bunda Kirani Foundation in Boyolali. Methods: The research design is a quantitative, pre-experimental, one-group, pre-test and post-test design. The intervention using MBSR techniques includes body scanning, sitting meditation, hatha yoga, and walking meditation, with a total of 15 respondents. MBSR interventions were conducted 10 times. The measurement instrument used in this study was the Perceived. The assessment instrument used in this study was the Perceived Stress Scale. The sampling technique used was purposive sampling. The data analysis was performed using the Paired t-test. Results: The largest sample had a high school education background, totaling 9 people (60%), the majority were 38 years old, totaling 3 people (20%), and the oldest sample was 48 years old, totaling 1 person (6.7%). There was a decrease in scores, with an average of 5.34 after\u00a0being given MBSR treatment. The hypothesis test showed a p-value of 0.000 (p < 0.05), indicating that there was a statistically significant effect of MBSR treatment on the stress of mothers who have children at Yayasan Bunda Kirani Boyolali. Conclusion: MBSR impacts the reduction of stress in mothers who have children with developmental disabilities and provides direct caregiving. \nKeywords : Children with special needs, Stress, Mindfulness, MBSR.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present the preliminary findings from a qualitative study (i.e., semi-structured interviews) on how a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program, carried out in the Software Development (SD) working context, is perceived by the software developers of a multinational company who participated in the MBSR program and by the instructor who led it. MBSR is a deeply personal and experiential practice in helping individuals manage stress, particularly in high-pressure environments such as workplaces, healthcare settings, education, and other demanding professional or personal situations. Although MBSR has been experimented in different working contexts; surprisingly, it has never been studied in the SD working context where there are several stress factors that developers experience (e.g., time pressure and uncertainty about the content of a particular task and its outcome). In this respect, qualitative research can generate valuable insights into the application of MBSR in the SD working context that cannot be captured by standardized quantitative measures. Being MBSR instructors and software developers the key stakeholders in delivering an MBSR program in the SD working context, understanding their first-hand experiences can provide a more detailed picture of the investigated phenomenon. The most important takeaway result of our research can be summarized as follows: despite initial skepticism, the developers recognized personal improvements due to the MBSR practice, though the integration of MBSR techniques in the working context remained challenging.",

Emotional fatigue, often underestimated, plays a critical role in reducing well-being and workplace productivity. Objective: This study investigates the effectiveness of mindfulness techniques in reducing fatigue and alleviating stress among working women. Method: A qualitative case study was conducted with five professional women who also manage domestic roles. Data were collected through in-depth interviews and observations during a series of mindfulness sessions. Result: Fatigue was found to stem not only from workplace demands but also from emotional strain at home. Participants who felt unappreciated, described as experiencing a hypo emotional tank, tended to carry negative emotions into their work, increasing stress and lowering performance. After mindfulness practice, most participants reported improved emotional balance, enhanced self-worth, and noticeable reductions in fatigue and stress. Conclusion: Mindfulness practices help working women manage stress and fatigue by fostering self-awareness and emotional resilience. Contribution: This study offers insights into the emotional burdens faced by working women and supports mindfulness as an effective intervention for improving psychological well-being and job performance.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adverse childhood experiences have been widely associated with psychological distress. A growing body of literature suggests that mindfulness and self-compassion may be a pathway linking adverse childhood experiences to psychological distress. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current meta-analysis was to investigate the mediating role of mindfulness and self-compassion in the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and psychological distress using structural equation modeling meta-analysis. METHODS: A systematic literature search initially identified 15,058 studies from three electronic databases: PsycINFO, Scopus, and PubMed. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 29 articles were eligible for inclusion in the current meta-analysis. Two-staged structural equation modeling meta-analysis was used to examine correlations among mindfulness, self-compassion, adverse childhood experiences, and psychological distress. This method estimated a pooled correlation matrix under a random-effects model. RESULTS: We analyzed 29 independent datasets containing data from 19,854 participants. The results showed that both mindfulness (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.09, 95\u00a0% CI [0.06, 0.12]) and self-compassion (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.09, 95\u00a0% CI [0.06, 0.11]) mediated the associations between adverse childhood experiences and psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: Given that the present findings were based on cross-sectional data, further research with rigorous designs, such as experimental and intervention studies, is needed to investigate the mediating effects of self-compassion and mindfulness on the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and psychological outcomes This review calls for further longitudinal research to test whether self-compassion and mindfulness act as mediators in the link between ACEs and psychological distress.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the association between affiliate stigma and mental well-being and the potential moderating role of psychosocial factors. METHODS: Data were from 101 family caregivers of people living with dementia (mean age=65.1, 86% female) that completed an online survey measuring affiliate stigma, mental health, social support, self-compassion, attitudes towards ageing, and positive meaning in caregiving. Hierarchical regression analysis with interaction terms and stratified analyses were employed to evaluate the moderating effects of psychosocial factors. RESULTS: Higher affiliate stigma was significantly associated with poorer caregiver mental well-being (\u03b2=0.30, p = 0.002). Stratified analyses indicated that the effect of affiliate stigma on well-being was less pronounced among caregivers with high self-compassion and positive attitudes towards ageing. None of the interaction terms were significant. CONCLUSION: Family caregivers might benefit from interventions that target self-compassion and positive attitudes towards ageing, such as mindfulness or educational programs, to promote well-being.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To comprehensively review the available literature on prehabilitation and rehabilitation exercise, nutrition, and psychological support interventions for patients with kidney cancer (KC), to summarise the clinically relevant efficacy and cost-effectiveness of interventions, to expose key knowledge gaps, and to inform future investigations and initiatives. METHODS: This review was performed according to the per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews Guidelines. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing programmes of prehabilitation or rehabilitation, exercise, psychological support, or nutrition components in patients with KC or KC caregivers from January 2004 to March 2022. Statistically significant positive (SS+) and negative (SS-) results were summarised. RESULTS: The systematic search yielded 10\u2009968 records including 18 RCTs, involving 2774 unique subjects, 706 of whom were KC patients/survivors. None included caregivers or assessed cost-effectiveness. Two interventions were implemented before surgery, one was implemented prior to initiation of systemic therapy, eight were implemented during systemic or radiation therapy, three were implemented after treatment, while implementation time was not specified for four interventions. CONCLUSION: Most (14/18) RCTs involving exercise, nutrition, psychological support, or prehabilitative or rehabilitative programmes for KC performed to date demonstrated SS+ results. The evidence was most robust regarding previously evaluated psychological support, especially mindfulness-based interventions (9/10 studies demonstrating SS+ improvement in primary outcomes), followed by therapeutically valid exercise with/without psychological support (5/8 RCTs demonstrated efficacy), then nutrition or pharmacological interventions (2/5 demonstrated efficacy). Level 1 evidence supports counselling patients and referral to mindfulness-based psychological therapy along with physical therapy or physical medicine and rehabilitation, as well as consideration of preoperative carbohydrate drinks. No studies have examined impact on caregivers, or cost-effectiveness, which are both critical areas for future study.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to explore how comprehensive psychological intervention combined with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) external therapy affects treatment adherence and quality of life in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The research included 124 patients from January 2023 to December 2023, randomly assigned to either a control group (n=60) receiving standard chemotherapy and routine care and an intervention group (n=64) receiving additional psychological support (mindfulness training, cognitive restructuring, group therapy) and TCM therapies (moxibustion, acupoint application, herbal fumigation). Results showed that the intervention group had significantly better chemotherapy completion (92.2% vs 85.0%) and dose intensity (89.1% vs 80.0%), with fewer delays (10.9% vs 20.0%) and regimen changes (15.6% vs 26.7%). Quality of life improved notably, particularly in emotional (\u0394=16.7) and social functions (\u0394=14.2). Psychological metrics also improved, with anxiety and depression rates dropping significantly. Additionally, the intervention group experienced fewer severe side effects such as myelosuppression, nausea, fatigue, and neuropathy. These findings suggest that combining psychological support with TCM therapies enhances treatment adherence, quality of life, and psychological well-being while reducing chemotherapy-related adverse effects, offering a promising approach for supportive care in breast cancer patients.",

A\u00a0common focus of palliative and integrative medicine is improving quality of life by alleviating symptoms. OBJECTIVES: What treatment options are available for frequently occurring symptoms in uro-oncology patients? METHODS: Based on current literature and international guideline recommendations, an overview of palliative and integrative medical therapies and their significance in the management of advanced uro-oncological tumors is given. RESULTS: Palliative care treatment options combined with complementary medicine can effectively contribute to symptom relief. The foundation of tumor pain therapy is medication, which can be effectively supplemented with acupuncture, for example. Medication and relaxation exercises can also have synergistic effects on sleep disorders. A\u00a0multiprofessional and interdisciplinary approach is also beneficial for the treatment of anxiety and depression, combining medication, psycho-oncological support, physiotherapy, social services, nutritional therapy, mindfulness exercises, meditative movement exercises, and so on. It is important that palliative and integrative medical support be offered early in the course of the illness. This support includes not only optimizing symptom relief but also communication with patients and their families and caregivers. CONCLUSION: Palliative medicine and integrative medicine offer the chance to improve the quality of life and symptom management in advanced uro-oncological cancer.",

The maintenance of the individual differences in N2 amplitudes were robust in the intervention group.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that participation in mindfulness martial arts may buffer against reductions in N2 activity during adolescence for youth with ADHD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Substance use disorders (SUDs) are a major global health burden, and third-wave therapies that target transdiagnostic processes such as psychological flexibility and mindfulness have emerged as promising options. This systematic review synthesized evidence on third-wave interventions for adults with diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder (DSM)-defined SUDs. METHODS: A comprehensive search of seven databases (2014-2025) identified randomized and non-randomized studies of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), related mindfulness-based programs, and dialectical behavioral therapy skills training. Two reviewers screened records, extracted data, assessed risk of bias with Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) and risk of bias in non-randomized studies of interventions (ROBINS-I), and synthesized findings using SWiM-consistent narrative methods. The review was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251028610). RESULTS: Forty-seven studies (35 randomized, 12 non-randomized) met inclusion criteria. Across modalities, third-wave interventions yielded small-to-moderate benefits on abstinence, craving, and substance use outcomes compared with control conditions, with larger and more consistent gains in psychological flexibility, emotion regulation, and mindfulness. Effect sizes varied and most trials showed some concerns or serious risk of bias, resulting in generally low-to-moderate certainty of evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Third-wave interventions may serve as adjunctive or alternative SUD treatments by engaging targeted mechanisms, enhancing psychological functioning, and producing modest but clinically relevant substance-use benefits. More rigorous, adequately powered mechanism-focused trials are needed to clarify comparative efficacy and guide process-based personalization and implementation in routine addiction services.",

      "abstract": "Medical hypnosis combined with mindfulness suggestions may improve pain management, but individual benefits are difficult to predict. This study compared the effects of hypnotic induction suggestions and different hypnotic suggestions for analgesia on acute experimental pain, considering hypnotic susceptibility (SHSS:A) and five mindfulness facets (FFMQ). Thirty-four healthy participants were administered phasic electrical stimulations during a Baseline condition, a Hypnotic induction alone condition, and experimental hypnosis conditions involving Imagery and Mindfulness-like suggestions of analgesia. Results showed significant pain reduction to all three hypnotic conditions compared to Baseline (EMMs\u00a0=\u00a018.98 to 23.76; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and highlighted the moderating role of dispositional factors. Imagery suggestions were more effective than Hypnotic induction (EMMs\u00a0=\u00a03.14, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and Mindfulness (EMMs\u00a0=\u00a04.78, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) but Mindfulness suggestions did not provide benefits over Hypnotic induction (EMMs\u00a0=\u00a01.64, p\u00a0=\u00a00.25). Individuals with higher hypnotic susceptibility (SHSS:A) and lower scores on the FFMQ's non-reactivity subscale reported significantly more analgesia (p's\u00a0<\u00a00.01). FFMQ's Non-judgement score positively predicted hypoanalgesia in Hypnotic induction suggestions (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), FFMQ's Description score positively moderated Hypnotic induction and Mindfulness suggestions effects (p's\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and FFMQ's Awareness score was a negative moderator of mindfulness's hypoalgesia suggestions (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). These findings confirm that mindfulness-like suggestions can be integrated to hypnotic interventions but indicate that they may not provide additional effect on acute pain responses, beyond standard hypnotic induction techniques. Importantly, different mindfulness dispositional characteristics may sustain or reduce the potential benefits of hypnosis interventions.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Despite the stress of having a baby in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), factors that promote adjustment remain unclear. We examined which resiliency factors were associated with family adjustment across the NICU journey. STUDY DESIGN: Parents with a baby in the NICU (\u22642 weeks) completed surveys at three timepoints (during admission (N\u2009=\u2009165); 1 month later (N\u2009=\u200985); 3 months later (N\u2009=\u200955)). Surveys included sociodemographics and validated measures of emotional distress, relational outcomes, and resiliency. RESULTS: Mixed models revealed that lower parental distress was associated with: (1) higher mindfulness; (2) more adaptive coping; (3) greater parental self-efficacy (only anxiety); and (4) increased parental time for themselves (only posttraumatic stress). Higher couple satisfaction was associated with more dyadic coping and social support. Stronger parent-child bonding was associated with greater parental self-efficacy. CONCLUSION: Mindfulness and coping are important for parental distress. Building parental efficacy, encouraging self-care, and promoting shared coping and social support is important.",

      "abstract": "In response to the demands of Sustainability 4.0 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this study explored the role of eco conscious internal communication in creating eco centric creativity among employees of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). We hypothesized that the link between supervisor environmental priority is mediated by sustainability-oriented mindfulness and eco conscious personal identity and that supervisor environmental priority strengthens these pathways. A three-wave survey design was employed; 800 questionnaires were distributed to SME (Small & Medium Enterprises) employees in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu, and 473 questionnaires were obtained after controlling for missing data. Eco conscious internal communication, supervisor environmental priority were measured at Time 1, sustainability-oriented mindfulness, eco conscious personal identity at Time 2 (four weeks after Time 1) and eco centric creativity was rated by supervisor at Time 3 (eight weeks after Time 1). Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS SEM) showed that eco conscious internal communication has a positive predictive relation with eco centric creativity (b\u202f=\u202f0.12, p\u202f=\u202f0.004). Sustainability oriented mindfulness (indirect b\u202f=\u202f0.187) and eco conscious personal identity (indirect b\u202f=\u202f0.065) mediated this relationship partially, and supervisor environmental priority enhanced the indirect relationship through eco conscious personal identity (b\u202f=\u202f0.03, p\u202f=\u202f0.001). The variance in eco centric creativity was explained by the model to 40.9\u202f%. These results indicate that clear sustainability communication activates employee creativity through cognitive and identity mechanism and that supportive leadership increases these effects. The study adds to the field by supporting both organizational and environmental psychology theories by showing how motivation and social identity processes work to achieve sustainable innovation and offers an actionable approach for SMEs to take in order to achieve the SDGs.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While research has uncovered intricate relationships between cognitive reactivity (CR), sleep quality, perceived stress, family function, mindfulness, and perinatal depression (PND), their temporal dynamics remain unclear. Previous studies have focused primarily on cross-sectional analyses or single-time-point associations and lack longitudinal exploration of the bidirectional relationships and temporal precedence between these variables. METHODS: The study was conducted in Fujian Province, China, from December 2021 to January 2023. A cross-lagged panel model was used to examine the temporal relationships among CR, sleep quality, perceived stress, family function, mindfulness, and PND in pregnant women at high risk for depression. A total of 329 participants completed a baseline questionnaire during the third trimester (T1) and completed follow-up assessments three months postpartum (T2). Standardized scales were used to measure key variables. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 26 and R 4.2.3 software, with the \"lavaan\" package employed for cross-lagged panel model construction. RESULTS: The findings revealed that the relationship between CR and depression among women at high risk of PND persisted over time due to autoregressive effects. PND at T1 was prospectively associated with changes in CR, family function, perceived stress, mindfulness, and sleep quality at T2 ( B\u2009=\u20092.467, -0.473, 0.878, -0.306, 0.393, P\u2009<\u20090.05). However, the cross-lagged effects of CR, family function, mindfulness, and sleep quality at T1 on the PND total score at T2 were not significant. The only exception was the significant positive cross-lagged effect of perceived stress at T1 on PND at T2. ( B\u2009=\u20090.102, P\u2009<\u20090.05). CONCLUSION: This study among high-risk women with PND found that late-pregnancy depression was prospectively associated with higher postpartum cognitive reactivity, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms, and with poorer family function, mindfulness, and sleep quality. These findings advance understanding of the dynamic interplay between perinatal psychological and interpersonal factors and highlight the need for early intervention during pregnancy. Clinically, strengthening depression screening and adopting targeted strategies-such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, family counseling, mindfulness training, and sleep optimization-may aid in the prevention, early detection, and treatment of PND, thereby safeguarding maternal mental health and infant well-being.",

Existing evidence-based treatments-including behavior therapy and pharmacotherapy-are often only partially effective, associated with burdensome side effects, and/or inaccessible. The current paper describes a randomized controlled trial designed to compare a novel, remotely delivered mindfulness-based group intervention for tics (MBIT) to psychoeducation with relaxation and supportive therapy (PRST) in 150 adults with TS. All interventions and assessments will be delivered remotely using secure telehealth platforms and online electronic data capture systems. An independent evaluator masked to treatment condition will administer all tic assessments. The primary aims of the study are to: 1) examine the efficacy of MBIT relative to PRST for tic severity and 2) investigate the mechanism by which MBIT reduces tic severity. Additional aims include: 1) examination of secondary outcomes (e.g., comorbid conditions, quality of life), and 2) exploration of the durability of any observed improvements over a 6-month follow-up. Findings have the potential to meaningfully expand the range of evidence-based treatment options available to adults with TS.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disruptive, multifaceted disorder with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 8.3% in the U.S. population. Yoga has been shown to reduce PTSD symptoms overall, though little is known about its efficacy relative to specific PTSD symptom clusters. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we examined the associations between yoga and symptom change in each DSM-5 PTSD symptom cluster. We hypothesized that yoga participation would be associated with significant reductions in each cluster, particularly alterations in arousal and reactivity/hyperarousal (AAR/H), relative to controls. We searched PubMed, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus for eligible studies published through October 2025. Studies that were yoga intervention randomized controlled trials, enrolled trauma survivors, and reported PTSD subscale scores were included. We computed standardized mean difference scores and used an NIH tool to assess risk of bias. In direct models (k = 9 studies), yoga led to small-medium reductions in intrusions, d = -0.31, p =\u00a0.027, and total PTSD symptoms, d = -0.29, p =\u00a0.030. When including age as a moderator, yoga also improved avoidance, d = -2.28, p =\u00a0.003, and AAR/H symptoms, d = -1.92, p =\u00a0.007. There was a substantial risk of bias across studies. Yoga showed the most robust effects for reducing intrusions and total PTSD symptoms, with efficacy in reducing avoidance and AAR/H symptoms when age was added as a moderator. Yoga's emphasis on mindfulness in the present moment may allow for attentional awareness that is protective against intrusions.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundExisting tools for assessing mindful eating tend to be too long to use in many settings.Aims/ObjectiveWe assessed if a Shortened Mindful Eating Inventory (sMEI) would perform similarly to a previously developed longer inventory.Methods/MethodologyThe sMEI was constructed by selecting the items with the highest factor loading from each subscale of the original Peitz Mindful Eating Inventory (MEI) study. Participants (n\u2009=\u2009224) completed the sMEI first and the MEI a month later to examine test-retest reliability. The Spearman's correlation coefficient was computed for sMEI and MEI scores overall and for demographic subgroups. Cronbach's alpha was computed to assess internal reliability and exploratory factor analysis was used to verify sMEI items loaded highly on MEI subscales.Results/FindingsThe mean age of the participants was 31.0 (SD 13.0) with 85.7% females. Overall, the sMEI and MEI were correlated (Spearman r\u2009=\u20090.73, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Among demographic subgroups, the correlation remained moderate to strong and similar (r\u2009=\u20090.62-0.76), but most highly correlated for females (r\u2009=\u20090.75, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and individuals 18-30y (r\u2009=\u20090.76, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Each sMEI item agreed closely (+/- 1-point) with its corresponding MEI item. The items also ranked high on factor loadings in their respective subscale, indicating their appropriateness as representing dimensions of mindful eating.ConclusionThe sMEI showed acceptable internal validity, good correlation with MEI, and sMEI items sufficiently represent each MEI subscale in our sample of mainly white female adults =< age 30. Therefore, in this population the sMEI may be a reasonable alternative when a longer measurement tool is not feasible.",
