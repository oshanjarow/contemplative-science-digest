      "abstract": "Mindfulness research is hampered by the multiplicity of definitions of mindfulness. This heterogeneity, as reflected in the variability of mindfulness scales, limits the ability to generalize findings and hinders attempts to synthesize available studies. This paper explores traditional and contemporary definitions of mindfulness, aiming to extract core components and provide a refined and clearly specified definition suitable for underpinning measurement in psychological science. This narrative review broadly analyzes and synthesizes the conceptual frameworks across various definitions of mindfulness to identify core components of mindfulness within Buddhist and psychological science literature. Traditional Buddhist definitions of mindfulness focus on (a) memory and remembrance, (b) present-centered awareness, and (c) ethicality, but lack conceptual commonality due to the diversity of Buddhist schools and to the intricate context in which mindfulness is embedded. Definitions in psychological science show greater conceptual agreement and emphasize (a) present-centered awareness and bare attention, and (b) attitudes of acceptance and non-judgment. Taken together, there is a lack of conceptual commonality and clarity on mindfulness definitions, to the extent that it may be challenging to propose a single definition that fully encapsulates both Buddhist and psychological science perspectives. For the purposes of psychological science, refinements are suggested by (a) including four scopes of mindfulness that clarify present-centeredness as awareness of and attention to body sensations, affective valence (i.e., pleasant, unpleasant, neutral), cognition and emotional states (including impulses and action tendencies), and the external environment (i.e., external sensory experience and interpersonal interactions); and (b) emphasizing the allowing and equanimous attitudes as the key qualities of mindfulness. Mindfulness is therefore defined as: \u201cpresent-centered awareness of and bare attention to body sensations, affective valence, cognitive and emotional phenomena, and the external environment with an allowing and equanimous attitude.\u201d The study is not preregistered.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: This systematic review outlines the neurocognitive outcomes and mechanisms of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) that influence subjective well-being. MBCT is a clinical intervention that integrates cognitive therapy with mindfulness practices to prevent depression relapses and improve mental health. Methods: The review focuses on the effects of MBCT on brain structure changes, cognitive processes, and emotional regulation, which are related to improvements in subjective well-being. A total of 87 studies were included in the review to assess the effectiveness of MBCT. Results: Evidence from the studies highlights the effectiveness of MBCT in reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. MBCT was also shown to enhance cognitive functions and emotional regulation across diverse populations. These findings point to the potential for MBCT to induce neuroplastic changes in the brain and widen the applicability of the treatment for a variety of disorders, calling for further research into long-term benefits and underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Conclusions: The review emphasizes the potential of MBCT to bring about neuroplastic changes, calling for further research into its long-term benefits and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. This study underlines the need to incorporate multidisciplinary measures by integrating psychology and neuroscience to comprehend comprehensively the effects of MBCT.",

      "abstract": "\n Recent research has suggested that metacognitions about social media use may play a role in social media addiction. The aim of the present study was to investigate (a) the contribution of positive and negative social media use metacognitions in explaining social media addiction after accounting for a range of risk factors related to negative affect and (b) the mediating roles of positive and negative social media use metacognitions in associating depression, anxiety, fear of missing out (FoMO), loneliness, and low trait mindfulness with social media addiction. A sample of 810 Australians (M\n age\u2009=\u200966.39\u00a0years; 63.6% female) completed an anonymous online survey. Both positive and negative social media use metacognitions accounted for a significant proportion of unique variance in social media addiction after controlling for age, sex, social media engagement, depression, anxiety, FoMO, loneliness, and mindfulness. Serial mediation models indicated that depression, anxiety, FoMO, loneliness, and mindfulness had a direct effect on social media addiction, as well as an indirect effect that was mediated by positive and negative metacognitions. The present study\u2019s findings show the mediating role of social media use metacognitions in the relationship between negative affect and social media addiction.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates the interplay between mindfulness, emotional intelligence (EI), and work engagement, focusing on the mediating role of EI. Utilizing Conservation of Resources (COR) Theory as a theoretical framework, the research explores how mindfulness enhances employee engagement by fostering emotional regulation, resilience, and attentional stability. Conducted within the Saudi Arabian context, the study employs a cross-sectional survey of 329 employees from diverse sectors, offering culturally specific insights into these relationships. The findings reveal that mindfulness positively influences both EI and work engagement, while EI significantly mediates this relationship, amplifying the positive effects of mindfulness on engagement. These results underscore the critical role of mindfulness and EI in fostering a resilient and motivated workforce. Practical implications suggest that organizations can enhance employee well-being and productivity by integrating mindfulness and EI training into workplace development programs. This study contributes to existing literature by extending the application of COR Theory and addressing the contextual nuances of Saudi Arabia, offering actionable insights for improving employee engagement in diverse organizational settings.\u00a0",

      "abstract": "With universities increasingly offering mindfulness-based interventions to enhance students\u2019 mental health conditions and alleviate the strain on overwhelmed psychological services, this study aimed to investigate the potential effectiveness of a brief VR-based mindfulness intervention for university students with depression and anxiety symptoms. Employing a quasi-experimental design, the present study assessed whether the intervention could enhance students\u2019 mindfulness, olfactory perception, and chemosensory while reducing anxiety and depression symptoms. Forty-nine university students (M\u2009=\u200922.06, 10 males) participated in this quasi-experimental study and were tested at three time points: T1 (pre-intervention), T2 (post-intervention), and T3 (follow-up). The intervention immersed participants in virtual environments featuring natural elements and integrated mindfulness practices. The Eligible participants displayed anxiety symptoms while engaged in the study. We also conducted person-to-person interviews and performed a thematic analysis to understand the participants\u2019 insights and feedback regarding the intervention, aiming to inform and improve the design of subsequent interventions. The findings indicated that the intervention showed an immediate and significant impact on reducing anxiety and depression symptoms while improving mindfulness, olfactory perception, chemosensory, and sensory image. Notably, this reduction in depression and anxiety symptoms persisted for one week. Furthermore, the intervention showed the potential to enhance mindfulness and sensory imagery, with these substantial effects also enduring for one week. Qualitative results further supported the findings from the interviews. This study provides preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of brief VR-based mindfulness interventions in alleviating depression and anxiety symptoms among university students.",

      "abstract": "Introduction The university experience often brings various personal and academic challenges that can negatively impact students\u2019 mental health. This research aimed to evaluate the effect of a mindfulness program on stress, anxiety, depression, sleep quality, social support, and life satisfaction among university students. Methods A quasi-experimental study was conducted with 128 participants, divided into experimental and waiting list control groups. The experimental group participated in a mindfulness meditation program consisting of 12 weekly sessions. Pre-test and post-test measurements were performed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOS-SS), and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) to assess the variables. Results The experimental group showed statistically significant differences between the study phases and the groups after the intervention for all the variables examined (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The effect sizes calculated using the HC3 model were stress (\u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.376), anxiety (\u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.538), depression (\u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.091), sleep quality (\u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.306), social support (\u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.704), and life satisfaction (\u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.510). The mindfulness program was shown to be effective in reducing levels of stress, anxiety, and depression while also improving sleep quality, social support, and life satisfaction in college students. Conclusion These findings indicate that mindfulness meditation may be valuable for enhancing psychological well-being in educational settings.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of Green Human Resource Management (GHRM) practices on employees\u2019 pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs) across multiple sectors in China, including production and manufacturing, real estate, financial services, and IT industries. Data were collected from 492 participants through online and offline surveys conducted between June and August 2024, ensuring a comprehensive and representative sample. The findings reveal that GHRM significantly enhances employees\u2019 PEBs, with green mindfulness and knowledge sharing as critical mediating mechanisms. These mediators amplify the effectiveness of GHRM by fostering deeper environmental awareness and encouraging the exchange of eco-friendly practices among employees. By integrating GHRM with knowledge management processes, the study highlights how organizations can strategically leverage HR practices to strengthen their environmental performance and foster a culture of sustainability. By emphasizing the pivotal roles of green knowledge sharing and environmental awareness, this research underscores their significance in bridging the gap between organizational practices and sustainability outcomes. The insights derived contribute to advancing theoretical understanding and practical applications of green knowledge management and sustainability, offering a robust framework for businesses seeking to align their operations with global environmental goals.",

Findings In this randomized clinical trial including 196 adults prescribed buprenorphine for opioid use disorder, mindfulness was not superior at reducing illicit opioid use compared with an active group intervention with an evidence-based curriculum. Both arms experienced significantly reduced anxiety, and the reduction in opioid craving during mindfulness groups was greater than during recovery support groups, a significant difference. Meaning The findings of this study suggest that mindfulness groups may have utility during opioid use disorder treatment, especially for patients with residual opioid craving while prescribed buprenorphine.",

      "abstract": "This study examined the effects of a 9-month mindfulness teacher training (MTT) program on mindfulness skills, emotion regulation, and psychological well-being among future mindfulness instructors, compared to a control group. Eighty-seven mindfulness instructors-in-training participated in the MTT program. The control group consisted of age- and gender-matched individuals. Mindfulness skills, emotion regulation, and psychological well-being were assessed at baseline, mid-intervention, and post-intervention using validated measures. In comparison with the control group, participants in the MTT group showed significant improvements in most facets of mindfulness (i.e., observe, describe, non-react, and act with awareness). They also reported decreased rumination, as well as increased personal growth and purpose in life compared to the control group. However, there were no significant differences between the groups in other dimensions of emotion regulation or psychological well-being. This study provides preliminary evidence that mindfulness teacher trainings positively affect mindfulness skills, as well as specific aspects of psychological well-being (personal growth and purpose in life), and emotion regulation (rumination). Future research should investigate the long-term effects of these trainings and how instructors\u2019 well-being relates to their teaching effectiveness. This study is not preregistered.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Mental health issues among university students are increasingly prominent, and effective interventions are urgently needed. Physical exercise has shown potential in improving mental health, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Based on the Conservation of Resources (COR) theory and the Dual - Factor Model of Mental Health, this study aims to explore the dual impact of physical exercise on university students\u2019 mental health and the chain - mediating effects of mindfulness and psychological resilience. Methods A cross-sectional survey was carried out on 720 students from Chinese universities. Validated instruments were used to measure physical exercise, mindfulness, resilience, and mental health outcomes. SPSS 27.0 and Mplus 8.3 were employed for data analysis, including descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and mediation effect testing. Results The findings show that physical exercise is a proactive resource investment behavior. It significantly enhances students\u2019 mindfulness and resilience. These psychological resources promote positive mental health indicators such as life satisfaction and positive affect, and at the same time, reduce negative factors like psychological distress. The chain mediation analysis indicates that mindfulness and resilience act as interconnected resources, which is in line with the \u201cgain spiral\u201d and \u201cresource caravan\u201d effects in the COR theory. Discussion This study provides novel insights by demonstrating how mindfulness and resilience sequentially amplify the psychological benefits of physical exercise. It offers a more detailed understanding of the mechanisms behind the improvement of university students\u2019 mental health. The results have significant theoretical and practical implications, advocating for the integration of exercise, mindfulness, and resilience-building strategies in mental health interventions for university populations.",

Our study aims to assess the effectiveness of mindfulness interventions in reducing ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents through a systematic review of relevant studies. Following PRISMA guidelines, our systematic review searched PubMed, Cochrane library, Psycinfo, and Scopus from January 2000 to August 2022. We included studies focusing on mindfulness for pediatric ADHD, comprising various study designs with a minimum 8-week duration. Descriptive statistics summarized results, while risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane RoB and ROBANS tools. The quality of RCTs was further evaluated using the Correlation of Quality Measures tool. In the initial search, 450 records were identified, and after removing duplicates, 339 underwent screening. Forty-one studies underwent full text assessment for eligibility, with 11 studies meeting inclusion criteria, including seven RCTs, two Quasi RCTs, and three cohort studies. These studies, conducted in five countries, involved participants aged 7 to 18 years. Six studies showed improvement in hyperactivity/inattentive symptoms, and five studies showed improvement in impulsivity. This systematic review demonstrates the potential benefits of mindfulness programs on ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents. This study emphasizes the need for high-quality research to explore mindfulness-based interventions for ADHD management in younger populations. PROSPERO registration number: IDCRD42024520800",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Social media addiction (SMA) and internet addiction (IA) are increasingly prevalent, impacting mental health (MH) globally. This study investigates the mediating roles of mindfulness and social capital (SC) in the relationship between SMA, IA, and MH among Ethiopian high school and university students, contributing to the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 of good health and well-being. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 1160 university and 1473 high school students in Dessie, Ethiopia. Participants completed validated questionnaires assessing SMA, IA, mindfulness, SC, and MH. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with a multi- mediation Model (SMM) was used to examine the hypothesized relationships. Results: SEM revealed that both SMA and IA had a direct negative effect on mindfulness, SC, and MH in in both high school and university students. Notably, mindfulness and SC significantly and positively predicted MH, indicating their protective role against the negative effects of SMA and IA. Furthermore, both mindfulness or SC fully or partially mediated the relationship between SMA, IA, and MH, highlighting their crucial role in explaining the association. Conclusions: This study provides evidence for the crucial roles of mindfulness and SC in buffering the negative effects of SMA and IA on MH among Ethiopian students. The findings highlight the need for educational and health interventions that foster mindfulness and SC to enhance student mental health and promote a healthy digital environment. These results offer valuable insights for educators, health professionals, and policymakers in Ethiopia and other developing countries facing similar challenges.",

      "abstract": "Background The global aging population and rapid development of digital technology have made health management among older adults an urgent public health issue. The complexity of online health information often leads to psychological challenges, such as cyberchondria, exacerbating health information avoidance behaviors. These behaviors hinder effective health management; yet, little research examines their mechanisms or intervention strategies. Objective This study investigates the mechanisms influencing health information avoidance among older adults, emphasizing the mediating role of cyberchondria. In addition, it evaluates the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation as an intervention strategy to mitigate these behaviors. Methods A mixed methods approach was used, combining quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Substudy 1 developed a theoretical model based on self-determination theory to explore internal (positive metacognition and health self-efficacy) and external (subjective norms and health information similarity) factors influencing health information avoidance, with cyberchondria as a mediator. A cross-sectional survey (N=236) was conducted to test the proposed model. Substudy 2 involved a 4-week mindfulness meditation intervention (N=94) to assess its impact on reducing health information avoidance behaviors. Results Study 1 showed that positive metacognition (\u03b2=.26, P=.002), health self-efficacy (\u03b2=.25, P<.001), and health information similarity (\u03b2=.29, P<.001) significantly predicted health information avoidance among older adults. Cyberchondria mediated these effects: positive metacognition (effect=0.106, 95% CI 0.035-0.189), health self-efficacy (effect=0.103, 95% CI 0.043-0.185), and health information similarity (effect=0.120, 95% CI 0.063-0.191). Subjective norms did not significantly predict health information avoidance (\u03b2=\u2012.11, P=.13), and cyberchondria did not mediate this relationship (effect=\u20120.045, 95% CI \u20120.102 to 0.016). Study 2 found that after the 4-week mindfulness intervention, the intervention group (group 1: n=46) exhibited significantly higher mindfulness levels than the control group (group 2: n=48; Mgroup1=4.122, Mgroup2=3.606, P<.001) and higher levels compared with preintervention (Mt2=4.122, Mt1=3.502, P<.001, where t1=preintervention and t2=postintervention). However, cyberchondria levels did not change significantly (Mt1=2.848, Mt2=2.685, P=.18). Nevertheless, the results revealed a significant interaction effect between mindfulness and cyberchondria on health information avoidance (effect=\u20120.357, P=.002, 95% CI \u20120.580 to \u20120.131), suggesting that mindfulness intervention effectively inhibited the transformation of cyberchondria into health information avoidance behavior. Conclusions This study reveals the role of cyberchondria in health information avoidance and validates mindfulness meditation as an effective intervention for mitigating such behaviors. Findings offer practical recommendations for improving digital health information delivery and health management strategies for older adults.",

      "abstract": "Although there is a growing number of studies investigating the effect of professional development (PD) on the general well\u2010being of teachers, the reverse relationship has not been explored yet. In this respect, this paper aims to investigate the relationship between mindfulness in teaching, psychological well\u2010being, satisfaction in life, subjective happiness, and the PD of English language instructors teaching at schools of foreign languages in various Turkish universities. Based on structural equation modeling, this paper analyzed quantitative data from 173 English language teachers to discover the relationship between these variables. Two models were tested. The first model was designed with \u201cpurpose in life\u201d as the extrinsic variable while the second model was centered on \u201cpersonal growth\u201d for psychological well\u2010being. The analysis of data revealed a significant positive correlation between teachers' intrapersonal mindfulness and aspects of psychological well\u2010being, including purpose in life and personal growth, as well as subjective happiness and life satisfaction. On the other hand, the study revealed no significant relationship between intrapersonal mindfulness and attitudes toward PD. These findings highlight that while mindfulness contributes positively to individual well\u2010being, it may not have a direct impact on attitudes toward PD. Furthermore, the research underscores the role of psychological well\u2010being and happiness in shaping teachers' perspectives on professional growth. These insights suggest the necessity for educational institutions and policymakers to focus on enhancing teachers' psychological health as a strategy for fostering their PD. These findings contribute significantly to the understanding of the complex relationship between psychological factors and PD, offering essential implications for future research and practical applications in the field of teacher education and development.",

One critical issue was its impact on mental health, as there were widespread reports of increased anxiety and stress among college students. This qualitative narrative review explores mindfulness practices as an effective intervention to support students\u2019 well-being and boost academic performance during such a crisis and beyond. This paper utilizes SANRA (Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles) guidelines to ensure a systematic and transparent synthesis of the literature. A total of 18 studies published in international peer-reviewed journals between 2020 and 2024 were included in the review. Mindfulness techniques have reduced stress, helped with emotional regulation, alleviated anxiety, and improved cognitive functions. Mindfulness programs have demonstrated success in helping students manage the uncertainties of online learning and the social isolation the pandemic lockdowns produced. Moreover, such techniques help students build resilience by boosting self-awareness and increasing student engagement with course material. This review highlights the effectiveness of these techniques in supporting students and educators during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the post-pandemic context. It offers valuable insights for educators and policymakers in navigating both crisis-driven challenges and future advancements in education.",

      "abstract": "Socio-economic and environmental factors significantly influence health by driving epigenetic changes that alter genetic expression and impact disease prevention. Lifestyle elements such as diet, exercise, mindfulness, and environmental exposure play crucial roles in modulating these mechanisms. A systematic review of studies from the past 13 years, conducted under PRISMA guidelines, examined interventions, epigenetic outcomes, and health impacts. Mindfulness practices, particularly meditation, were found to regulate DNA methylation, reducing stress and inflammation. Dietary interventions, such as the Mediterranean and DASH diets, enhanced health biomarkers and slowed epigenetic aging through favorable DNA methylation. Physical activities, such as high-intensity interval training and hybrid training, induced epigenetic modifications, improving metabolic function, mitochondrial biogenesis, and insulin sensitivity. These findings emphasize the importance of adopting modern lifestyle choices to promote health and prevent chronic diseases by influencing gene expression. Combining mindfulness, balanced diets, and regular physical activity offers substantial benefits for metabolic, cardiovascular, and mental health. However, more research is needed to understand the long-term effects of lifestyle factors on epigenetics and to develop personalized strategies that optimize disease prevention and overall wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into language education is rapidly transforming English as a foreign language (EFL) learning environments, presenting both opportunities and challenges. While AI\u2010supported tools offer potential benefits, they can also trigger complex test\u2010related emotions that may impact learners\u2019 psychological and academic well\u2010being. Therefore, understanding the interplay between internal resources like self\u2010esteem and academic mindfulness, alongside these emotions, becomes crucial. This study investigated the correlations between self\u2010esteem and academic mindfulness with test emotions, psychological well\u2010being and academic achievement among EFL learners in AI\u2010supported contexts in China. To meet this purpose, a quantitative approach was employed, using data collected from a sample of 305 EFL university students (155 males and 150 females) in China selected through stratified random sampling. The analysis was conducted via confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling using SMART PLS software. The results indicated that self\u2010esteem and academic mindfulness were strong predictors of test emotions, psychological wellness and academic achievement. Higher levels of academic self\u2010esteem and academic mindfulness were linked to higher test emotions, psychological well\u2010being and academic achievement. These findings stress the necessity of incorporating socio\u2010emotional skills into AI\u2010enhanced EFL learning, considering students\u2019 psychological well\u2010being when deploying AI tools and designing interventions to address emotional challenges within AI\u2010supported environments.",

      "abstract": "The postpartum period has witnessed increasing rates of depression and anxiety, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, with these conditions often co-occurring and being exacerbated by the lingering effects of long COVID. Traditional interventions, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and yoga, have demonstrated effectiveness in alleviating these symptoms. However, the limitations of in-person sessions, especially in the context of pandemic-related restrictions, highlight the need for accessible, innovative approaches. Integrating Virtual Reality (VR) technology with these traditional practices presents a novel solution, offering immersive, customizable environments that may enhance engagement and therapeutic outcomes. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a VR-enhanced mindfulness and yoga intervention in treating postpartum depression and anxiety in women affected by long COVID, with additional examination of underlying physiological stress markers and cognitive control mechanisms. In this randomized controlled trial, 111 postpartum women were randomly assigned to experimental (VR-enhanced intervention), control (traditional in-person sessions), or blank groups using computer-generated randomization. The 8-week intervention involved thrice-weekly 60-minute sessions. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 4-week follow-up using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, salivary cortisol measurements, and an emotional Stroop task. The VR-enhanced intervention group demonstrated significant improvements in both depression (EPDS: P\u2009<\u20090.001, \u03b7p2\u2009=\u20090.18) and anxiety symptoms (GAD-7: P\u2009<\u20090.001, \u03b7p2\u2009=\u20090.17), with these therapeutic effects significantly greater than those observed in the control and blank groups (P\u2009<\u20090.001 for both comparisons). These improvements were strongly correlated (r\u2009=\u20090.68, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Supporting these primary outcomes, salivary cortisol levels showed a significant decrease (P\u2009<\u20090.001, \u03b7p2\u2009=\u20090.13), and cognitive control improved as evidenced by reduced emotional Stroop task conflict effect (P\u2009<\u20090.001, \u03b7p2\u2009=\u20090.37). Correlation analysis revealed robust associations between improvements in depression and anxiety symptoms and changes in physiological markers in both short-term and long-term outcomes. This study demonstrates that integrating VR technology with traditional mindfulness and yoga practices effectively reduces both postpartum depression and anxiety symptoms in the post-COVID era. The parallel improvements in physiological stress markers and cognitive control provide insight into potential mechanisms underlying these therapeutic effects. These findings underscore the value of immersive technology in enhancing traditional therapeutic approaches for addressing postpartum depression and anxiety in the post-pandemic context.",

      "abstract": "The inclusion of behavioral therapy and stress reduction techniques among vocational students of the Nigerian universities is crucial for enhancing their practical skill acquisition and career prospects in challenging academic scenarios. This study explored the combined effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction in reducing test anxiety among business education students in a measurement and evaluation course. Employing a randomized control trial with a pretest-posttest design, the research draws responses from 483 students from two universities in Southeast Nigeria. The participants were randomly assigned to either the treatment or waitlist control groups on the basis of set inclusion criteria. Data collection was conducted via four different instruments, and the treatment group participated in a Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (CBT-MBSR) program. Evaluations of both groups were conducted at three different stages: before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and during the follow-up period. Analysis was carried out via repeated-measures ANOVA and multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). The results indicated that TVET students who underwent the CBT-MBSR intervention had significantly lower post-treatment test anxiety scores than those in the wait-list control group. The intervention also had a significant multivariate effect on reducing test anxiety, improved mindfulness, students\u2019 academic achievement, and their well-being (F value\u2009=\u20091168.52 (p\u2009=.001, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.752). This study assessed the efficacy of CBT with MBSR in reducing test anxiety, improving academic performance, and increasing well-being among students in TVET settings. The study revealed how CBT helped reduce test anxiety, thereby improving students\u2019 academic performance through increasing their concentration. Thus, this study provides fresh knowledge on how to improve psychological well-being and educational performance by introducing a new method of combining MBSR and CBT, which enriches the literature with a dual-modality approach that helps students reduce their anxieties and fosters their personal growth. This study has practical implications for university administrators, educators, and researchers and offers several recommendations. Not applicable.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMenopause is associated with significant physical, psychosocial, and emotional changes that can negatively affect women's quality of life (QoL). In response to this, psychological interventions like mindfulness-based interventions have shown promise in alleviating menopausal symptoms and improving psychological well-being.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA comprehensive randomized controlled trial was conducted from May to August 2024 at Damanhour University, Egypt. One hundred and twenty menopausal women were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n\u2009=\u200960), which participated in seven mindfulness sessions, or the control group (n\u2009=\u200960), which received general health education. Pre and postintervention data were collected using the Menopause-Specific QoL questionnaire, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale. Independent samples t-tests were performed to compare groups, while paired t-tests assessed within-group changes post-intervention. Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen's d, ensuring a robust and reliable data analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe intervention group showed significant improvements across all domains of menopause-specific QoL, including vasomotor (d\u2009=\u20090.788, p\u2009<\u20090.01), psychosocial (d\u2009=\u20091.042, p\u2009<\u20090.01), physical (d\u2009=\u20090.809, p\u2009<\u20090.01), and sexual (d\u2009=\u20090.794, p\u2009<\u20090.01). Additionally, significant reductions were observed in anxiety (d\u2009=\u20091.221, p\u2009<\u20090.01), stress (d\u2009=\u20091.030, p\u2009<\u20090.01), and depression (d\u2009=\u20090.880, p\u2009<\u20090.01), along with a significant increase in mindfulness (d\u2009=\u20091.335, p\u2009<\u20090.01) postintervention.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe MBIS significantly improved menopause-specific QoL and reduced anxiety, stress, and depression while enhancing mindfulness in menopausal women. These findings suggest that mindfulness-based interventions could be game changers in managing menopausal symptoms and improving overall psychological well-being, offering hope for a better QoL for menopausal women.\n\n\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE\nThe research will primarily impact healthcare providers working with menopausal women, particularly those offering psychological support or nonpharmacological treatments. It also impacts menopausal women themselves by providing evidence-based intervention options that could alleviate menopausal symptoms. Furthermore, researchers and policymakers focusing on women's health and mental well-being may use these findings to inform future studies and healthcare strategies.\n\n\nPATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION\nWomen from Damanhur University.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nThis trial was registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov database under the registration number NCT06421909.",

What does Black radical imagination look like in academic spaces of research, conferences, and publications to produce a vision of equity? This article explores how academic conferences often serve as a precursor to publishing and a platform for re-imagining radical spaces and addressing the accessibility of scholarly information. I critically examine the role of self-appointed gatekeepers of Black consciousness who act as experts on Black culture, often distorting or eliminating historical information in publications and conferences. Using the conceptual framework of Black radical imagination, I center Black consciousness to decolonize academic spaces and challenge access to Black scholarship. I share my experiences and the reflections of a first-time Black art education student attendee on the impact of academic gatekeepers' lack of empathy toward Black American history and culture. I advocate for radical approaches by Black scholars to re-envision Black futures, fostering radical hope amidst the challenges of researching and publishing opportunities.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Non-dual awareness (NDA) refers to a shift in consciousness in which the usual distinction between subject and object dissolves, and experience is no longer structured by conceptual mediation or goal-directed regulation. Meling enactivist model describes NDA as a meditative disclosure of groundlessness\u2014the recognition of emptiness (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101), that all phenomena lack intrinsic nature. While enactivism explains autonomy through process closure, this article argues that constraint closure, as developed by Nave, extends that framework by making explicit how autonomy is sustained through the continual regeneration of its own relational conditions. This refinement prevents process-closure models from being read in substantialist terms when applied to complex cognitive systems, where stability arises through ongoing transformation rather than fixed organization. Nave\u2019s account builds on Juarrero theory of constraint causality, which replaces intrinsic forces with relational conditions\u2014a view that parallels N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s Madhyamaka analysis of dependent origination. Integrating these perspectives, I propose that NDA corresponds to a shift from decoupled to precarious constraints, revealing that cognition and awareness persist not through intrinsic foundations but through the dynamic regeneration of interdependent relations.",

      "abstract": "The nature of consciousness and its relationship to physical reality remain among the most profound scientific and philosophical challenges. This paper presents a novel framework that integrates consciousness with fundamental physics, proposing that consciousness is not an emergent property of neural processes but a foundational aspect of reality. Building upon insights from quantum field theory and non-dual philosophy, a model based on the three principles of universal mind, universal consciousness, and universal thought is introduced. These principles describe an underlying, formless intelligence (mind), the capacity for awareness (consciousness), and the dynamic mechanism through which experience and differentiation arise (thought). Within this framework, the emergence of space\u2013time and individual awareness is modeled mathematically by treating universal consciousness as a fundamental field. Differentiation into individual experience occurs via mechanisms such as symmetry breaking, quantum fluctuations, and discrete state selection\u2014paralleling established concepts in physics, including Bohm\u2019s implicate order, Heisenberg\u2019s potentia, and Wheeler\u2019s participatory universe. This model suggests that the apparent separateness of individual consciousness is an illusion, with all experience ultimately arising from a unified, formless substrate. The framework aligns with emerging theories in quantum gravity, information theory, and cosmology that posit classical space\u2013time as emergent from a deeper pre-spatiotemporal order. It offers a non-reductionist alternative in neuroscience, suggesting that consciousness interacts with physical processes as a fundamental field. By drawing from insights from physics, metaphysics, and philosophy, this conceptual framework proposes new directions for interdisciplinary inquiry into the nature of consciousness and the origins of structure and experience.",

      "abstract": "Under the context of non-dyadic human\u2013machine interaction in intelligent coal mines, this study investigates the impact of different dyadic collaboration modes on Team Situation Awareness (TSA). Based on a simulated coal mine monitoring task, the experiment compares four working modes\u2014Individual Operation, Supervised Operation, Cooperative Operation, and Divided-task Operation\u2014across tasks of varying complexity. TSA was assessed using both objective (SAGAT) and subjective (SART) measures, alongside parallel evaluations of task performance and workload (NASA-TLX). The results demonstrate that, compared to Individual or Supervised Operation, both Cooperative and Divided-task Operation significantly enhance TSA and task performance. Cooperative Operation improves information integration and comprehension, while Divided-task Operation enhances response efficiency by enabling focused attention on role-specific demands. Moreover, dyadic collaboration reduces cognitive workload, with the task-sharing mode showing the lowest cognitive and temporal demands. The findings indicate that clear task structuring and real-time information exchange can alleviate cognitive bottlenecks and promote accurate environmental perception. Theoretically, this study extends the application of non-dyadic interaction theory to intelligent coal mine scenarios and empirically validates a \u201cCollaboration Mode\u2013TSA\u2013Performance\u201d model. Practically, it provides design implications for adaptive collaboration frameworks in high-risk, high-complexity industrial systems, highlighting the value of dynamic role allocation in optimizing cognitive resource utilization and enhancing operational safety.",

Based on 156 primary studies (N\u2009=\u200923,371), we found that (1) OA, PA, and MA each uniquely predicted word reading within first language (L1) and second language (L2); (2) L1 OA, PA, and MA predicted their corresponding skill in L2, showing a construct-level transfer facilitation effect; (3) for cross-over transfer, L1 PA, as opposed to L1 OA and MA, predicted L2 word reading, but their indirect effects on L2 word reading were all significant. Moderator analysis was conducted on L1 background (Chinese vs. non-Chinese); L2 learning context (ESL vs. EFL); and developmental stage (younger vs. older). We discuss the transfer facilitation effects of L1 metalinguistic awareness skills that can be leveraged for effective and differentiated instruction for DLLs.",

      "abstract": "Human behavioral awareness is usually socially relevant, decisions are made based on the behavior of individuals, and this dynamic process of human awareness with herd effects is called awareness cascade. Based on the complexity of modern information dissemination, information is not monolithic. Individuals choose the type of epidemic-related information to accept, i.e., whether it is positive or negative information, according to the awareness cascade, and then take the corresponding measures to cope with the epidemic. In this paper, we use the microscopic Markov chain approach to model an information-virus dual network, where the information layer has a threshold model with awareness cascade of positive and negative information, and on the virus layer is a susceptible-infected-recovery model with epidemic infection time delay and recovery time delay. The time delay is also a non-negligible modeling factor as the complete infection of an individual and the complete recovery of an individual require sufficient time. An explicit formula for the critical threshold of epidemic spread for this model is derived. We find that positive and negative information and time delay have a significant effect on the critical threshold, and the recovery time delay is the time delay that mainly affects the epidemic size. Experiments show that the local acceptance rate of positive information has a threshold point for the spread of epidemics under awareness cascade, and that this point is significantly affected by the mass media. The local acceptance rate of negative information also divides the spread of epidemics into two stages.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion, and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness, designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks, and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.",

Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was used to test the validity of the measuring instrument, and Multiple Regression Analysis was used to test the research hypotheses. \nMain Findings: The results of the study indicate that there is a joint influence of environmental awareness and health on the pro-environmental behavior of people living in Tondo District, Manila, Philippines. The results of the minor hypothesis test indicate that general belief, personal attitude and health self-monitoring have a significant influence on Pro-environmental. The results also show that the proportion of Pro-environmental variance explained by all independent variables is 26.9%, while the remaining 73.1% is influenced by other variables outside this study. \nNovelty/Originality of this study: The novelty of this study lies in its integrated examination of environmental awareness and health as dual predictors of pro-environmental behavior in society. Unlike previous studies that focused solely on the ecological or health dimensions, this research offers a holistic perspective, highlighting how shared awareness influences people's sustainable actions in their daily lives.",

      "abstract": "\n Although awareness of gender inequality can motivate collective action, it does not always translate into a greater willingness to engage in collective action to promote gender equality. This study investigated how sociocultural contexts and individual awareness of gender inequality jointly shaped normative and non-normative collective action intentions. Drawing on cross-cultural data from 61 societies (\n N\n = 31,393), we found that individual awareness of gender inequality was associated with stronger collective action intentions, both normative and non-normative, aimed at promoting gender equality. However, macrolevel sociocultural factors moderated this relationship. Specifically, higher levels of societal gender inequality and power distance weakened the translation of individual awareness into action intentions. In contrast, greater societal individualism strengthened this translation. These findings underscore that promoting gender equality globally requires a dual focus on addressing not only individual-level awareness but also the broader structural environments that affect collective action intentions.\n",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective This study aims to explore how sociodemographic, psychological, and quality of life factors impact dual-task performance among elderly individuals in Iraq. Methods This cross-sectional study included 384 healthy community-dwelling participants aged 60\u2009years and over, recruited from Najaf, Iraq. Data were collected using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21), Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Form (WHOQOL-BREF). Dual-task performance was assessed using the Nine-Hole Peg Test (NHPT) combined with a cognitive task of counting backward by threes. Correlation and multivariate regression analyses were conducted to determine the predictors of cognitive dual-task performance. Results Among the WHOQOL domains, only physical health significantly predicted dual-task performance for both dominant and non-dominant hands (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.234, p\u2009=\u20090.041; \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.263, p\u2009=\u20090.025, respectively), underscoring the importance of physical well-being in cognitive-motor functions. Psychological factors (depression, anxiety, and stress) measured by DASS-21 did not significantly predict dual-task performance. The model explained a small part of the variance in dual-task performance, suggesting that other factors may influence these abilities in elderly individuals. Conclusion While psychological factors measured by DASS-21 did not significantly impact dual-task performance, the overall quality of life remained essential. These insights can inform the design of elderly care programs.",

      "abstract": "Recent developments in positive psychology and spiritual practices suggest a nuanced pathway to enhancing psychological well-being through the cultivation of mindfulness, interoception, and balanced dual emotions. This article explores the conceptual progression from mindfulness to interoception, further leading to an understanding of internal values and the strategic balancing of the dual emotions of silence and happiness. Mindfulness, defined as the non-judgmental focus on the present moment. Interoception, or the awareness of internal body sensations, complements mindfulness by enhancing self-regulation. The integration of silence and happiness as dual emotions contributes to mental clarity which is crucial for reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. Happiness, associated with positive social interactions and compassion, plays a critical role in the promotion of relational well-being. By maintaining a balance between these emotions, individuals may experience enhanced well-being through improved hormonal balance and psychological resilience. Supported by spiritual practices that emphasize egolessness and contentment, this model proposes that mindfulness, interoception, and dual emotion management can synergistically foster a health-promoting environment, both psychologically and physiologically. This research involving development of Heal-thy Life Spiritual Psychology Assessment Scale (HLSPAS) aims to synthesize these elements into a coherent model that contributes to the broader understanding of psychological well-being, drawing from spiritual experience and practice in these areas.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates how various task allocation strategies and communication modalities influence Human-AI Team performance in dynamic dual-task environments. Utilizing a modified Ballas Task simulator, the research involved 32 participants with military or similar backgrounds to evaluate four task allocation strategies \u2013 Operator Monitoring, Action Split, Target Split, and Take Over. These strategies were assessed under different levels of transparency and communication modes while participants engaged in concurrent tracking and tactical assessment tasks. The results indicate that the effectiveness of task allocation is contingent upon both transparency and the communication modality employed. Operator monitoring consistently reduced workload and assessment time, while enhancing tracking performance, target accuracy, and situational awareness \u2013 particularly when paired with verbal communication under low transparency. In contrast, non-verbal communication improved situational awareness and reduced tracking errors in the action split and target split strategies. Although take over yielded fewer advantages compared to the other strategies, it still surpassed the performance of an all-human baseline. These findings provide actionable insights for enhancing human-AI collaboration in high-stakes, time-sensitive contexts, with relevance extending beyond military operations to a variety of dynamic dual-task environments.",

On the acoustic side, we extend orthogonal wide-aperture fusion to handle arbitrary inter-sonar translations (enabling heterogeneous, non-co-located models) and extract a leading edge from each FLS to form line-scans. On the mapping side, we modify LIO-SAM to ingest both stereo-derived 3D sonar points and leading-edge line-scans at and between keyframes via motion-interpolated poses, allowing sparse acoustic updates to contribute continuously to a single factor-graph map. We validate the system on real-world data from Belvederekanalen (Copenhagen), demonstrating real-time operation with approx. 2.65 Hz map updates and approx. 2.85 Hz odometry while producing a unified 3D model that spans air-water domains.",

      "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of thyroid nodules in ultrasound images is critical for clinical diagnosis but remains challenging due to low contrast and complex anatomical structures. Existing deep learning methods often rely solely on local nodule features, lacking anatomical prior knowledge of the thyroid region, which can result in misclassification of non-thyroid tissues, especially in low-quality scans. To address these issues, we propose a Spatial Prior-Guided Dual-Path Network that integrates a prior-aware encoder to model thyroid anatomical structures and a low-cost heterogeneous encoder to preserve fine-grained multi-scale features, enhancing both spatial detail and contextual awareness. To capture the diverse and irregular appearances of nodules, we design a CrossBlock module, which combines an efficient cross-attention mechanism with mixed-scale convolutional operations to enable global context modeling and local feature extraction. The network further employs a dual-decoder architecture, where one decoder learns thyroid region priors and the other focuses on accurate nodule segmentation. Gland-specific features are hierarchically refined and injected into the nodule decoder to enhance boundary delineation through anatomical guidance. Extensive experiments on the TN3K and MTNS datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in boundary precision and localization accuracy, offering practical value for preoperative planning and clinical decision-making.",

      "abstract": "Ultrasound imaging is a prevalent diagnostic tool known for its simplicity and non-invasiveness. However, its inherent characteristics often introduce substantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ segmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we propose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to enhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual semantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we introduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a channel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames, effectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on pixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional local features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with conditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent frames. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation, significantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since our model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly higher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some image-based models.

      "abstract": "Sensor networks play a critical role in many situational awareness applications. In this paper, we study the problem of determining sensor placements to balance coverage and connectivity objectives over a target region. Leveraging algebraic graph theory, we formulate a novel optimization problem to maximize sensor coverage over a spatial probability density of event likelihoods while adhering to connectivity constraints. To handle the resulting non-convexity under constraints, we develop an augmented Lagrangian-based gradient descent algorithm inspired by recent approaches to efficiently identify points satisfying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. We establish convergence guarantees by showing necessary assumptions are satisfied in our setup, including employing Mangasarian-Fromowitz constraint qualification to prove the existence of a KKT point. Numerical simulations under different probability densities demonstrate that the optimized sensor networks effectively cover high-priority regions while satisfying desired connectivity constraints.",

      "abstract": "Against intensifying climate risks, a paradox persists in green finance: high corporate awareness yet low green bond issuance. This study examines the impact of climate risk on green bond issuance using a final sample of 5958 bond issuances, which were issued by 469 unique A-share non-financial listed companies in China between 2016 and 2023. By integrating the Fogg Behavior Model (FBM) into a Motivation\u2013Capability\u2013Triggers framework and employing Logit and Karlson\u2013Holm\u2013Breen (KHB) methods, we investigate the underlying mechanisms. The baseline results show a positive link between climate risk and issuance likelihood, confirming a motivation-incentive effect. Mechanism analyses reveal significant negative mediation through financing constraints, green innovation, and environmental reputation, highlighting a capability-constraint effect. Heterogeneity analysis finds a stronger effect in non-state-owned firms, non-heavily polluting industries, and firms in pilot zones or central/western China, indicating that policy signals and resource endowments act as key triggers to synergize motivation and capability. Our findings offer valuable insights for policymakers in designing motivation-stimulating and capability-compensating intervention strategies to help firms balance economic and environmental objectives.",

      "abstract": "Musical expertise is often associated with heightened perceptual sensitivity to external sensory stimuli, yet its relationship with internal bodily awareness (interoception) remains elusive. This study examined whether interoceptive ability relates differentially to varying levels of singing expertise and explored if interoception could predispose individuals to musical skills. Professional singers, amateur singers, and non-singers completed a heartbeat discrimination task (interoceptive accuracy; IAcc), self-reported interoceptive sensibility assessment, and comprehensive musical competence measures. Results demonstrated a significant positive association between singing expertise and IAcc, which notably emerged only in professional singers, who significantly outperformed both amateur singers and non-singers. Regression analyses indicated a moderate predictive role of accumulated singing practice for IAcc among trained singers, though emotional awareness partially mediated the relationship between expertise and IAcc. Critically, higher IAcc in non-singers significantly correlated with superior singing accuracy, suggesting enhanced interoception may facilitate singing competence independently of formal vocal training. Altogether, these findings highlight a dual role of interoception, linking it to expert-level singing\u2014partially mediated by emotional awareness\u2014 and independently to musical competence in non-singers. These results reconcile prior inconsistencies by highlighting the embodied nature of singing and the distinct role of musical expertise, while underscoring inherent musically relevant mechanisms beyond practice alone.",

The patient\u2019s initial electrocardiogram showed right bundle branch block, first-degree AV block, and left anterior hemiblock (trifascicular block), and echocardiographic examination revealed increased trabeculation in the left ventricle. Since the patient\u2019s mother and father were consanguineous, a homozygous missense mutation was detected in the ryanodine receptor type 2 gene within the scope of clinical exome sequencing in the genetic test performed. Considering the family history, a dual-chamber epicardial implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation was performed. This case highlights the treatment process of a patient with a significant family history and a ryanodine receptor type 2 gene mutation, commonly associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, aiming to raise awareness of the disease.",

      "abstract": "Militaristic language is pervasive in cancer discourse across media, fundraising, politics, healthcare, and science, despite longstanding critiques from both civilian and military perspectives. Critics argue that framing cancer as a war or battle can lead to feelings of shame and inadequacy, particularly for those with metastatic cancer. This language often diverts focus from prevention and early detection strategies, complicating public perception and understanding of cancer. Two distinct research gaps related to the use of militaristic language in cancer discourse remain unaddressed: the role of dual-use technologies and the perspectives of individuals with wartime experience. Dual-use technologies, initially developed for military applications, have significantly advanced cancer diagnosis and treatment. Yet, their historical and ethical implications are largely absent from public discourse and scientific literature. Awareness of the complex role that dual-use technologies play in cancer diagnostics and treatment, as well as in other societal areas, could influence the prevalence of militaristic language used to describe challenges like cancer, drugs, poverty, and other civil issues. Secondly, studies have not examined opinions on the use of militaristic language among individuals with firsthand wartime experience, \u2014 such as civilian victims, military personnel, veterans, pacifists, and aid workers \u2014 compared to those without such experience. Both of these omissions may skew findings and overlook diverse perceptions. Addressing these research gaps could foster a more respectful public cancer discourse that takes into account the experiences of affected individuals. This commentary expands on existing critiques, urging professionals to adopt nuanced and inclusive language for cancer and other peaceful topics. Militaristic language is outdated, ethically questionable, and should not be used in science, healthcare, politics, fundraising, or other public contexts. Plain Language Summary Cancer is a major global health issue, causing illness and death worldwide, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Interestingly, in peaceful regions, people often use warlike language and metaphors when discussing cancer, whether in fundraising efforts, political debates, scientific research, media stories, or other contexts. However, in regions affected by war and conflict, healthcare systems face significant challenges, exacerbating the difficulty of managing cancer effectively. Most scientific studies on this war-themed language in cancer contexts originate from wealthier, peaceful regions. Unlike cancer, diseases like mental illnesses, considered \u201clow-prestige,\u201d are seldom described using war language. This difference highlights how societal values influence the way we talk about, perceive, fund, and prioritize treatment for various illnesses. This paper identifies two major blind spots in the research on war-like language and cancer: first, the lack of input from people who have lived through war, such as civilian victims, war refugees, military personnel including veterans, aid workers, and others; second, the oversight of how dual-use technologies\u2014originally developed for military purposes\u2014play a crucial yet complex role in cancer care. Understanding these technologies might change how we use war language not just for cancer, but for other issues in civilian life too. Using militaristic language to talk about cancer is not only outdated but also raises ethical concerns. It\u2019s time to rethink our words and avoid military language and rhetoric in science, healthcare, politics, fundraising, and other public contexts.",

      "abstract": "Informative warnings can improve takeover performance in automated vehicles, but improper or excessive information may hinder it. This study investigates the optimal amount of information in urgent and non-urgent autonomous takeover transitions. Forty-five drivers were randomly assigned to groups receiving different amounts of the selected takeover warning information elements. Each group completed simulated takeover tasks in four scenarios with different urgency. Takeover performance, situation awareness, and stress levels were measured. The results indicate that, in urgent situations, single-element assistance delays takeover response, while three elements increase failure risk. However, dual-element assistance yields faster response, equivalent awareness, and minimal stress. In non-urgent situations, having three elements leads to the best awareness and lowest stress compared with having fewer elements. In conclusion, an appropriate and non-overwhelming level of information facilitates urgent takeover performance, whereas greater information is advantageous in non-urgent cases. These findings provide insights into designing appropriate warning amount assistants for automated driving takeover requests across varying time-pressure situations.",

      "abstract": "As digital technologies and automation continue to reshape the maritime industry, the focus is gradually shifting from technical to non-technical skills among seafarers. With machines increasingly taking over routine operational tasks, competencies such as communication, decision-making, and situational awareness are becoming essential for safe and effective shipboard operations. This study investigates the role of non-technical skills in maritime transportation by drawing on insights from expert consultations and a systematic review of academic literature. Through this dual approach, five core competencies were identified as particularly relevant to safe and effective shipboard operations: teamwork, communication, situational awareness, decision-making, and leadership. To assess the relative importance of these competencies, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was employed, enabling structured prioritization based on expert judgments. This method provided a clear understanding of which non-technical skills are most critical in contemporary maritime contexts. Results highlight situational awareness as the most critical non-technical skill, underlining its importance in dynamic and high-risk environments. The findings offer practical guidance for maritime training providers and organizations aiming to improve crew development, recruitment, and operational safety through a more targeted focus on non-technical skills. \n \nKeywords: AHP, Human factor, Multi criteria decision making, Non-technical skills",

      "abstract": "Growing climate concerns and rising consumer awareness of sustainability have reshaped strategic interactions in platform-based supply chains. This study examines how a manufacturer and an e-commerce platform make channel and fulfillment decisions under cap-and-trade regulation. The manufacturer chooses between non-encroachment and agency encroachment, while the platform decides between conventional and sustainable fulfillment. To capture the dynamic adaptation of boundedly rational agents, we develop an evolutionary game model (EGT) and characterize the evolutionary stable strategies. The findings indicate the following: (1) Platform investment in sustainable fulfillment exerts a strategic stabilizer effect, effectively protecting the reselling channel by reducing the manufacturer\u2019s incentive to encroach even under moderate commission rates; (2) there exists a regulatory substitution effect between carbon pricing and commissions, where high carbon prices force manufacturers to encroach for survival, while low commissions encourage encroachment for profit; (3) consumer sensitivity exhibits a critical threshold behavior, where a synchronized transition to joint sustainability is impossible unless awareness exceeds a specific tipping point. Managerial insights suggest that platforms should view green logistics as a retention strategy to prevent channel fragmentation, while policymakers must coordinate carbon taxation with consumer awareness campaigns to avoid locking the system into non-green equilibria.",

Mindfulness practices can nurture presence, resilience, and compassionate care, yet many structured programs are too time-intensive for busy clinical environments. The Brief Intentional Grounding (BIG) Moment, a nurse-developed, 1- to 3-minute mindfulness practice, was created to restore balance, reduce stress, and support holistic well-being within the flow of care. In this pre-post intervention study, 30 ICU nurses at an urban safety-net hospital participated in a 3-month program including a 20-minute educational video and encouragement to practice The BIG Moment once or twice per shift. Perceived stress, measured with the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale, decreased significantly from baseline to 1 and 3 months (P < .001). Results demonstrate that The BIG Moment is a brief, sustainable, and integrative practice that promotes nurse well-being and strengthens the healing environment.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Combat sport athletes are exposed to higher rates of injury, often resulting in increased anxiety and decreased pre-event self-efficacy. Mindfulness may serve as a protective buffer against these psychological effects. This study aimed to examine the relationship between athletic mindfulness and pre-event self-efficacy through competitive anxiety, as well as the moderating role of injury status among taekwondo athletes. METHODS: Collegiate taekwondo athletes (N = 105) completed measures of athletic mindfulness, competitive anxiety, pre-event self-efficacy, and injury status prior to a national competition. A moderated mediation model was tested using PROCESS Models 4 and 59. RESULTS: Athletic mindfulness significantly predicted pre-event self-efficacy through cognitive anxiety. Although injury status did not moderate the overall mediation pathway, it moderated the relationship between athletic mindfulness and cognitive anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a pathway through which mindfulness enhances pre-event self-efficacy by reducing cognitive anxiety among combat sport athletes. Regardless of its moderation of the mediation effect, injury status revealed that mindfulness exerted a stronger influence on reducing cognitive anxiety among injured athletes.",

      "abstract": "This research examines an artificial intelligence-driven personalized intervention system that integrates physical exercise and mindfulness practices to support academic performance and psychological wellbeing among university students in eastern China. A 16-week controlled intervention study enrolled 328 undergraduate students from three comprehensive universities, comparing three conditions: AI-personalized interventions (n\u2009=\u2009110), standardized interventions (n\u2009=\u2009108), and controls (n\u2009=\u2009110). The AI system employed machine learning algorithms to analyze multidimensional student data and generate tailored recommendations. Results indicated that the AI-personalized group was associated with larger improvements across academic metrics (10.28% GPA increase, 95% CI [8.94, 11.62], d\u2009=\u20090.89, p\u2009<\u20090.001), psychological parameters (36.7% stress reduction, 95% CI [33.2, 40.1], d\u2009=\u20091.42, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and physiological indicators (28.4% HRV improvement, 95% CI [24.8, 32.0], d\u2009=\u20091.13, p\u2009<\u20090.001) compared to standardized interventions and controls. Regression analysis identified intervention adherence, sleep quality improvement, and stress reduction as factors associated with outcomes. The hybrid neural network architecture combining student feature analysis, exercise matching, and mindfulness adaptation offers a framework for personalized health interventions in academic settings. These findings, while promising, are specific to Chinese university contexts with particular cultural and technological characteristics, and cross-cultural validation remains necessary before broader generalization.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is the most severe type of stroke characterised by high morbidity and mortality rates. While prognostic scales aim to predict outcomes based solely on medical information, clinicians' assessments may be influenced by patients' social factors potentially resulting in inequitable care. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A vignette-based survey presenting five pairs of fictitious ICH cases (10 total) was distributed to professionals involved in ICH patient care. Each pair included identical medical data and a comparable computed tomography scan. Social factors - including family status, employment, home status, and medical history - were varied. Respondents assessed prognosis, recommended management, and identified key factors influencing their decisions. Only healthcare professionals involved in the treatment of neuro-intensive care patients were eligible to participate. RESULTS: A total of 172 responses were collected, of which 156 were from physicians. Statistically significant differences were observed across all case pairs with regard to prognosis, initial management and further treatment. Cases with less favourable social backgrounds were more likely to result in delayed treatment or recommendations for palliative care. Notably, when participants were asked which factors influenced their decisions, only an average of 10-11% acknowledged that social factors had played a role in their clinical reasoning Conclusions: Social factors seem to influence clinicians' prognostic assessments and management decisions in ICH cases, suggesting unconscious bias is present. These findings highlight the need for strategies to ensure equitable treatment, for example, bias-awareness training.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Over the past two decades, positive psychology research has identified correlates of resilience. Although a range of strengths have been explored, there is a need to identify specific strengths that best support individuals to thrive after interpersonal trauma and adversity. This study assessed the contribution of 24 strengths from the Values in Action (VIA) positive psychology survey, alongside five other measures of strengths identified from resilience research, to identify those that show most promise. METHOD: In total, 1,440 adults from the United Kingdom and Ireland completed the online VIA survey, and questions on five psychosocial strengths (ecoconnections, mindfulness, psychological endurance, sense of purpose, and social support), adversities (interpersonal victimization and institutional betrayal), and current functioning (subjective well-being, posttraumatic growth, and health-related quality of life). RESULTS: In the first U.K. and Ireland study to assess institutional betrayal alongside other interpersonal adversities and a range of resiliency factors, participants reported high rates of victimization and other trauma. Strengths accounted for greater proportions of variance in all three outcomes compared to adversities. Hope and zest were significantly and positively associated with all three outcomes. Sense of purpose, gratitude, social support, mindfulness, psychological endurance, spirituality, and self-regulation were positively related to at least one outcome. Humor, spirituality, fairness, and leadership were associated with worse functioning in some analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Some strengths are more helpful than others for overcoming adversity, and could serve as useful targets for intervention to mitigate the burden of interpersonal adversity. Further work is needed to understand the complexities of strengths on resilience in global contexts. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2026 APA, all rights reserved).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Self-management plays a vital role in noncommunicable disease prevention and control. However, it has been challenging for patients and their caregivers to identify how much their lifestyle affects their health and what level of effort they should make to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks in everyday life. Therefore, knowing their own CVD risk and daily health-related situations will provide relevant information for self-management by those at risk. The need to help individuals understand their relevant information creates an opportunity to investigate whether and how to implement a combined digital and nurse-led self-management intervention in a real-world community setting. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a combined approach combining digital device support, including a smartwatch, a mobile app, and a salt meter, with nurse-led case management, on self-management behaviors and clinical outcomes. METHODS: This study uses a combination of a nurse-led self-management with a digital and mobile health innovative approach, including tailored small group face-to-face education sessions, a smartwatch, a smartphone health app, and a salt meter, to increase the self-management behaviors to reduce vascular risk through designing and testing an integrated community-based strategy targeted at adults and older adults at risk of CVD in Thailand. The study uses a single-arm pretest-posttest design to assess the intervention's effects. The intervention will consist of the following components: (1) an interactive face-to-face education session; (2) a real-time knowing your numbers strategy using a smartwatch, a smartphone health app, and a salt meter; (3) a mindfulness-based stress management strategy using Somporn Kantaradusdi-Triamchaisri technique meditation healing exercise; and (4) a self-management diary. Quantitative data will be collected using a smartwatch, a salt meter, a food diary, and questionnaires at baseline and at the end of week 6. Clinical outcomes will be assessed at baseline, primary end point (wk 12), and secondary end point (wk 24). RESULTS: This study, funded in January 2025, will involve 45 patients. We received ethical approval on May 31, 2024, and began recruitment for participation in May 2025. Researchers will collect, analyze, and synthesize to evaluate the study procedure. We expect to complete data collection by December 2025, with the first results submitted for publication in March 2026. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a combined digital device and nurse-led case management may identify the use of digital health to support self-management and improve vascular health. The findings of this study will provide insights for a large-scale randomized controlled trial and for ongoing improvements in the noncommunicable disease care system.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer survivors frequently experience acute and chronic psychological distress, which negatively affects quality of life. Mindfulness-based interventions have emerged as integrative supportive care strategies to improve psychosocial outcomes in this population. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of mindfulness practices compared with standard care in improving quality of life among women surviving breast cancer. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including women aged \u226518 years at any breast cancer stage who had completed primary treatment, had no psychiatric disorders, and no previous mindfulness experience. Twelve RCTs met eligibility criteria, comprising 1620 participants-849 assigned to mindfulness interventions and 771 to standard care. Risk of bias was predominantly low across studies. RESULTS: Mindfulness-based interventions resulted in a small but statistically significant improvement in quality of life (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.36; 95\u00a0% CI: 0.20 to 0.53). According to the GRADE approach, the certainty of evidence was rated as moderate due to moderate heterogeneity (I LIMITATIONS: Considerable heterogeneity across interventions and outcomes, the predominance of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) protocols, the limited inclusion of metastatic patients, and potentially attenuated benefits in individuals with early-stage disease may have influenced effect estimates. CONCLUSION: Mindfulness practices are associated with meaningful improvements in quality of life in breast cancer survivors and, given their accessibility and applicability, may be recommended as part of comprehensive survivorship care.",
