      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The purpose of the present study is to determine feasibility and acceptability of a standardized hypnosis\u2013oriented intervention for a mystical experience based on a conceptual framework including cognitive expectancy, demand characteristics, the induced hypnotic state, and the role of hypnotizability. Ten college student participants provided informed consent and underwent a hypnosis-based exercise designed to facilitate a mystical experience. The hypnosis\u2013oriented intervention was provided in a setting similar to that used in psychedelic drug research. All participants were in the mid-to-high range of hypnotizability. Results revealed that the hypnosis\u2013oriented intervention was feasible and acceptable based on a composite acceptability score of 9.45 and no dropouts. All participants indicated that they would participate again if given the opportunity. Additionally, 70% of participants met criteria for a \u201ccomplete mystical experience\u201d as measured by the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30). While these results are encouraging, additional research is needed, including replication with a larger sample.",

      "abstract": "Introductions: Mystical experiences are powerful experiences that may have therapeutic value. Ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, has shown potential to induce mystical experiences. However, little research has explored this phenomenon, particularly in treatment-resistant depression. Methods: We analyzed clinical data from 60 veterans with treatment-resistant depression receiving a total of 189 ketamine treatments. Veterans either received intranasal esketamine or racemic parenteral ketamine (intravenous or intramuscular). The Revised Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ-30) was administered following ketamine treatments to assess the occurrence of mystical experience. A linear mixed model was used to examine the association between MEQ-30 scores and several treatment-related variables including gender, age, treatment number, dose, comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder, and pretreatment depression rating scores (PHQ-9). Results: Complete mystical experience was reported in 17.02% of esketamine treatments and 18.19% of racemic ketamine treatments. In the esketamine group, a greater number of treatment sessions was associated with higher MEQ-30 scores (p = 0.05). In the racemic ketamine group, higher doses were associated with higher MEQ-30 scores (p = 0.002). Discussion: These findings suggest that ketamine can occasion mystical experiences in veterans with treatment-resistant depression. Future studies should further explore the mystical-type effects of ketamine as a potential contributor to its therapeutic effect in treatment-resistant depression.",

In search of a theoretical elaboration of the phenomenon of human mystical life, this paper analyses the views of five Polish philosophers: Mieczys\u0142aw Gogacz, Piotr Moskal, Jan A. K\u0142oczowski, Stanis\u0142aw Judycki and Leszek Ko\u0142akowski. Their publications sought to answer questions about the nature of mystical experience and its ontic and epistemic conditions and characteristic structural elements. Particular attention was also paid to the context of religious life in which this kind of experience usually occurs, as well as to the fundamental concepts of mysticism as both practice and doctrine.",

      "abstract": "Fear of death and disease preoccupied the European consciousness throughout the early modern era, becoming most acute at times of plague and epidemics. In these times of heightened anxieties, images of saints and protectors served to reassure the faithful of their religious protection against infection. Modes of visual engagement and devotional subject matter were coupled in new ways to reinforce the emotive impact of art works and to reaffirm the perceived reality of the afterlife. In this context, a visual language of mystical devotion, which overcame the limits of the body and even eroticised its suffering, could serve the needs of the desolate and the pained. In this series of essays focused on spiritual sensibilities in Renaissance art and its legacies, authors present original ideas about the themes of death, disease, and mystical experience, based primarily on the study of objects and their documented historical contexts. Methodologically wide-ranging in approach, the resulting volume provides novel insights into the interplay between suffering and art making in the Western world.",

      "abstract": "In the twenty-first century, academic approaches to mysticism often risk reducing the Mystery to an object of erudition and historical distance, as if mystical experience belonged solely to a pre-modern past. Yet, when one encounters the \u201cnatural metaphors\u201d that emerge within mystical writings\u2014images of rivers, gardens, fire, and wind\u2014it becomes almost impossible to silence the invitation to perceive the sacred as still unfolding in the present. This article proposes an embodied and associative reflection that brings into conversation the poetry of John of the Cross (1542\u20131591), the intimate diaries of Etty Hillesum (1914\u20131943), and the musical and visual work of the contemporary artist Bj\u00f6rk Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir (b. 1965). Through this triadic encounter, I argue that natural metaphors are not mere literary ornaments but symbolic languages that articulate the ineffable through the elemental languages of the earth. They sustain a theology of embodiment, relationality, and transformation that traverses epochs and artistic media. The study also seeks to fracture rigid and hegemonic readings that have confined mystical texts within colonial geographies of interpretation\u2014readings that domesticate spiritual experience through rigid doctrinal frameworks. In contrast, this essay advocates for a decolonial hermeneutics of the mystical imagination, one that recognizes how the natural, the esthetic, and the spiritual interweave in the polyphony of the world. By reading John of the Cross, Hillesum, and Bj\u00f6rk together, I suggest that mystical experience continues to unfold today through poetry, diary, and sound\u2014where theology becomes not only a matter of thought but of vibration, beauty, and embodied openness to the Mystery.",

      "abstract": "For more than four decades, the emphasis in the academic study of world religions has been on differences over similarities, and comparative analyses allowing for commonalities have become increasingly rare. This article argues that similarities nonetheless exist and should be studied. After disclaiming the judgment of other scholars that Aldous Huxley attempted to describe the \u201ccore\u201d or \u201cessence\u201d of mystical experience, the article continues with a description of Huxley\u2019s unitive mystical experience as simply a thread running across the traditions, evidenced by the fact that it is often found in both the primary and secondary literature of mysticism. The essay then goes on to cite descriptions of unitive experiences in research studies with psychedelics. Given that these experiences regularly occur with psilocybin and other drugs, as studies show, the article argues that the use of psychedelics is currently providing a rich source of experiential reports from which scholars of mysticism may glean insights. Furthermore, based on the views of Huxley, and supported by the reports of Roland Griffiths, Jussi Jylkka, David Yaden, William Richards, Julie Holland and others, the article speculates about the possible benefits of unitive mystical experiences triggered by psychedelics for both the individual and society.",

      "abstract": "On the basis of the comparative method the differences in the religious experiences of F.M. Dostoevsky and K.N. Leontiev are explored. The author defends the thesis that it was this difference that first of all caused ideological contradictions between these thinkers, in particular, a sharp disagreement on the problem of the attainability of \u201cuniversal harmony\u201d in the world. It is shown that the basis of Dostoevsky's religious faith was a kind of mystical experience \u2013 the experience of self-transcendence and unity with the eternal sources of being, with Christ and with mankind. The author maintains that the peculiarity of Dostoevsky's mystical experience lies in the fact that it is based mainly on moral intuitions \u2013 the intuition of respect for every human person and the intuition of love for Christ \u2013 which, due to their extreme intensity, acquire the character of a religious revelation. It is proved that Dostoevsky's most important ideas, such as the possibility of universal harmony, the necessity to transform the human heart by means of sacrificial love and compassion, every man\u2019s responsibility for all humanity, have mystical origins. The author shows that, on the contrary, Leontiev's religious worldview, which the philosopher himself called \u201cmysticism\u201d, was based not on mystic, but on existential experience. The author comes to the conclusion that existential philosophizing, based on the experience of boundary situations of dread and despair, was for Leontiev a way of obtaining the peace in faith and of developing his Christian worldview.",

      "abstract": "The study of decision making is currently significant in various areas of knowledge, particularly in an interdisciplinary approach involving psychologists, economists, sociologists, cognitive scientists, and political scientists. This article explores the decision-making process in a new field: the mystical lived experience; i.e., approaches the perception of something present as unknown, the perception of mystery, within the decision-making process. It emphasizes that every perception requires a response, more or less conscious, and the mystical lived experience is no exception. The goal is to enhance our understanding and interpretation of the dynamics of mystical experience using a phenomenological analysis of the decision-making process as a hermeneutic key. The philosophical and anthropological background of this article draws from Karl Rahner\u2019s transcendental experience, while the phenomenological and psychological perspective is informed by Louis Roy\u2019s experiences of transcendence and Juan Martin Velasco\u2019s studies on mysticism. The article first establishes the theoretical foundations of this new approach and then applies a decision-making analysis to the significant decisions made by St. Ignatius of Loyola, as detailed in his autobiography.",

On this basis, Sufism also evinces mystical experience from which the Sufis elaborate some terminological concepts such as fan\u0101\u2019, wahdat al-wuj\u016bd, ittih\u0101d, etc. As a qualitative study with a type of library research, this article employs content analysis to provide an in-depth interpretation of the texts analyzed, especially literature relevant to the field of study. The results of the analysis demonstrate twofold. On the one hand, Sufism is arguably Islamic mysticism due to its emphasis on mystical experience about God. On the other hand, Sufism has its own uniqueness since it also pays much attention to moral development and human behavior. In addition, Sufism has great contribution and significance to Islamic civilization in particular and modernity in general, ranging from Islamic psychology, metaphysics, art and literary world to human peace and spiritual crisis.",

      "abstract": "Mystical religious experiences typically purport to engage with the transcendent and often claim to involve encounters with spiritual entities or a detachment from the material world. Daoism diverges from this paradigm. This paper examines Daoist mystical experiences of bodily transformations and explores their epistemological implications. Specifically, we defend the justificatory power of Daoist somatic experiences against the disanalogy objection. The disanalogy objection posits that mystical experiences, in contrast to sense perceptions, are not socially verifiable and thereby lack prima facie epistemic value. We argue that some Daoist mystical bodily states, being essentially spatiotemporal, are exempt from this challenge. This leads to a broader understanding of mysticism and offers a partial resolution to the disanalogy objection.",

      "abstract": "Background: Delusions are common positive symptoms in schizophrenic patients. Individuals with delusional disorders have different experiences in memory and beliefs. Exploring patients\u2019 delusional beliefs is crucial to ascertaining appropriate psychotherapy programs. A few studies have explored the meanings of delusions for delusional patients. This study explores how schizophrenic patients lived experiences about their delusional beliefs. Materials and Methods: The study was carried out at a psychiatric hospital in Indonesia in 2021. The participants included 30 adult schizophrenic patients who had delusional life experiences and were able to communicate. Open-ended questions and probes were applied during in-depth interviews. We interviewed family members as well to improve the rigor of the research. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used in this study. Results: The patients\u2019 clinical history revealed the experiences of failure and loss. Two main themes shaping their delusional experiences included demonic forces and magical powers. Conclusions: Patients with delusions had similar themes, but each had a different specific experience. The findings suggest that each patient may require a unique cognitive therapy based on their experience.",

      "abstract": "This article examines one of the least studied aspects of the theological and philosophical thought of St. Gregory Palamas, viz. his doctrine of the Divine selfcontemplation. This teaching has previously been mentioned only briefl y and shortly by the following scholars: protopresbyter John Romanides, Reinhard Flogaus, Father Dr. Porphyrios (Fadi) Georgi, Mikhail Yuryevich Reutin. However, the topic of the Divine self-contemplation is key to reconstructing the Palamite doctrine of how man perceives the uncreated Divine light (i.e. God). In his refl ections, St. Gregory proceeds from the principle that \u201clike is known by like\u201d. According to this principle, he asserts that the uncreated light cannot be known (or seen) by the created \u201ccognitive faculties\u201d of man (neither by the \u201cintellect\u201d, nor by \u201csense\u201d), since the uncreated is utterly unlike to the created. Therefore, the light itself becomes for man the \u201cObject\u201d, the \u201cFaculty\u201d and the \u201cSubject\u201d of the vision of God; the light (as \u201cSubject\u201d) contemplates itself (as \u201cObject\u201d) by means of itself (as \u201cFaculty\u201d) \u201cthrough\u201d (\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac) man. \u0391ccording to Palamas, the selfcontemplation of the Divine energy (light) is the eternal life of God. In this context, he speaks of the \u201cself-seeing\u201d (\u03b1\u2018\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd) and \u201cself-thinking\u201d (\u03b1\u2018\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd) light, which sees and thinks itself. The concept of the Divine self-contemplation is closely linked with other concepts of Palamite metaphysics: the Divine self-reversion and the doctrine of the participation of all creation in the \u201ccreative\u201d and \u201cdeifying\u201d Divine energies. Within the framework of semantic parallels among these concepts, the participation of all creation (both intelligent and non-intelligent) in the \u201ccreative energy\u201d (\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u203a \u0153\u03bd\u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) can be interpreted as the Divine self-contemplation / selfreversion through all creation, which gives it being and upholds its existence; while the participation of intelligent creation in the \u201cdeifying energy\u201d (\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u00a3\u03c2 \u0153\u03bd\u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) can be understood as 1) the union of man and angels with the \u201cilluminations\u201d (\u0153\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03bc\u03c8\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2), that is deifi cation, and 2) their vision of the Divine light.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates the philosophical and mystical concept of \u2018\u0100lam al-Mith\u0101l (The Imaginal World) in Islamic thought as analternative framework for understanding religious experience. Despite the acknowledgement of its importance, contemporary discourse has yet to undertake a systematic philosophical inquiry into how \u2018\u0100lam al-Mith\u0101l, as a spiritual epistemology, provides rational grounds for affirming the objective reality and transformative capacity of religious experiences, surpassing interpretations that reduce such experiences to merely subjective or psychological interpretations. This research addresses this gap by analyzing how Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101\u2019s ontological principle of A\u1e63\u0101lat al-wuj\u016bd (fundamentality of existence) and epistemological principle of Itti\u1e25\u0101d al-\u2018\u0100qil wa al-Ma\u2018q\u016bl (union of the intellect and the intelligible) substantiate the objective reality of experiences within \u2018\u0100lam al-Mith\u0101l. The study further examines the essential role of ta\u2019w\u012bl (esoteric interpretation) in unveiling the deeper meanings of symbolic encounters in this realm. By integrating these philosophical principles, the paper demonstrates how \u2018\u0100lam al-Mith\u0101l offers a rigorous framework for validating religious experiences as genuine perceptual events within an objective, intermediate reality. This framework challenges reductionist modern paradigms and highlights the imaginal realm\u2019s significance in self-realization and the acquisition of divine knowledge.",

      "abstract": "Psychotic processes remain poorly understood mental states. This review aims to examine the spiritual challenges and discrepancies surrounding psychosis, and the role cultural backgrounds and beliefs play in determining whether a psychotic episode is considered a pathological condition. The article explores mediumship, shamanism, and mystical experiences, examining their similarities and differences with psychosis. Symptoms of psychotic episodes are often viewed as pathological rather than simply different or less understood. The spiritual world remains a controversial topic in the scientific community. However, an openness in exploring this realm may help provide meaning and guidance to patients with psychosis. Mediumship, shamanism, and mystical experiences all involve altered states of consciousness and perceived interactions with spiritual realms; however, they differ in their conceptual foundations, cultural contexts, and functions. It is important to recognize that attributing spiritual meaning to a psychotic episode does not automatically rule out the possibility of an underlying pathology. Factors such as nutritional deficiencies or biochemical imbalances should be carefully considered before assigning spiritual significance to a symptom. This article aims to explore the complex interplay between these phenomena and psychosis, highlighting how their overlaps can complicate diagnosis and make treatment even more challenging. Further research on the subject could help to establish links between tangible and intangible aspects of life and bring to light new alternative approaches to address psychosis.\u00a0",

With \u201cnarrow\u201d I refer both to the specific understanding of mystical states that has become dominant in the literature, and the tendency to focus on mystical experiences specifically, out of all possible altered states. I finally analyze some criteria, external to the phenomenology of extraordinary experiences, that one might appeal to in order to justify restricting a neo-perennialist account, or study, to (certain) mystical states. I close the essay with a call to (1) refine the definition of \u201cmystical experience\u201d, and (2) push the cross-cultural study of altered states of consciousness beyond mystical states.",

This study explored auto-induced cognitive trance (AICT) as a method to induce mystical-type experiences and NDE outside of life threatening situations (NDE-like), as well as examining the influence of factors like religious/spirituality practices, and paranormal beliefs. Twenty-seven participants capable of self-inducing AICT were studied. Before the experiment, their religious/spirituality practices and paranormal beliefs were assessed. Participants underwent five conditions: rest, rest with auditory stimulation, imagination, AICT, and AICT with auditory stimulation. Experience intensity, mystical-type experiences, and NDEs-like were measured before and after AICT and rest. Results showed that AICT induce mystical-type experiences more frequently (29%) compared to the rest condition (0%). More specifically, the intensity of the experience and features of NDEs-like during AICT were linked to mystical-type experiences during AICT only. This is the first study to demonstrate that AICT can induce mystical-type experiences in healthy individuals.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Mystical experiences (MEs) are often profound and transformative encounters with a transcendent reality. Reported across many cultures and religions, these experiences are commonly characterized by a sense of unity, transcendence of time and space, positive mood, ineffability, and a noetic quality. Theoretical models have emphasized psychological, neurological, and sociocultural explanations to account for their positive effects on individuals, and psychometric tools have been developed to offer standardized methods to assess experience intensity and impact. MEs indicate significant potential in clinical psychology and have demonstrated psychotherapeutic benefit in the treatment of various conditions. We propose a novel conceptual framework to guide future use of MEs in therapeutic contexts, as interest in the mystical realm exponentially grows. The framework centers around the ME itself highlighting a requisite non-ordinary state of consciousness to foster intensely felt experiences occasioning profound psychological impact. The framework posits that MEs require three pre-state factors: invitation, context, and individual aptitude. After experiencing an ME, a necessary mediating factor in experiencing beneficial change is the process of integration.",

      "abstract": "This study examines the determinant role of athletic mental energy on the flow state in professional football (soccer) players. This research fills an important gap in the sports psychology literature by focusing on the interaction between mental energy and flow, a critical component of optimal performance. Accordingly, 254 male athletes (Mean age\u2009=\u200923.1\u2009\u00b1\u20095.4 years) voluntarily participated in the study. This study was designed with the relational survey model, one of the quantitative research models. Athletic Mental Energy Scale and Dispositional Flow State Scale-2 were used as data collection tools. After confirming the validity and reliability of the scales, the data were analyzed. In this study, blank data were first evaluated to check the suitability of the analysis and assumptions. After the structure of the scales was verified, firstly, when the skewness kurtosis values for the normality test were examined, it was deter-mined that the data were suitable for normal distribution as the values were between \u2212\u20091.5 and +\u20091.5 and the Q-Q graph did not show deviations from the distribution. In this context, Pearson Correlation Analysis was used to determine the relationship between athletic mental energy and flow state, and structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis was used to determine the determinant role of mental energy. Mental energy significantly predicted the flow state (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.81, p\u2009<\u20090.05), and the SEM results indicated a good model fit (\u03c7\u00b2/df\u2009=\u20092.96, RMSEA\u2009=\u20090.08, GFI\u2009=\u20090.89, CFI\u2009=\u20090.90). When the findings obtained from the research were analyzed, it was determined that athletic mental energy was a determinant of flow and contributed to 66% of the variance. As a result, it supports that athletes\u2019 mental energy levels play an important role in their performance and contribute to the increase of optimal performance mood. These findings suggest that coaches and sports psychologists should focus on strategies to enhance athletes\u2019 mental energy levels, such as incorporating mental skills training into their routines. The study emphasizes the importance of athletes\u2019 ability to manage their mental energy levels and the development of strategies to increase optimal performance mood. By providing evidence for the link between mental energy and flow, this study contributes to advancing the understanding of performance optimization in professional sports.",

      "abstract": "In research on flow as a constitutive trait, alongside appropriate levels of attention and motivation, the balance between task challenges and individual skills is emphasized. However, accurately determining the optimal balance to maximize the intensity of the flow state remains a complex task. It is evident that both variables, task challenge and individual skills, are interrelated. Nevertheless, how to precisely express the degree of matching between these variables in explaining the flow state remains an open question. One of the recent proposals for analyzing the (mis)matching of predictor variables explaining outcomes is Response Surface Analysis (RSA). In this study, we employed RSA to verify whether the skill-challenge balance could indeed occur in a configuration that best explains the flow state. We measured flow using the Flow Short Scale, which consists of two subscales: fluency and absorption. The study included 528 participants who were online board game players and were asked to assess their perceived skill levels and the current challenge of the game. RSA revealed two intriguing phenomena concerning both the fluency scale and absorption: firstly, flow is higher when the perceived level of skills exceeds task challenge compared to situations where perceived skills are lower than task challenge; secondly, flow is higher when both perceived skill levels and task challenge are higher compared to when they are at low levels. These findings shed light on a crucial aspect of the occurrence of flow, related to perceived skill levels and subjective task challenge.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background One\u2010on\u2010one professional support during labor is recognized for its role in promoting physiological birth, reducing interventions, and enhancing women's birthing experiences. Throughout physiological birth, many women encounter an altered state of consciousness. This state not only facilitates the normal birth process but also empowers women during and after childbirth. Recently, the flow\u2014a mental state of complete absorption and energized focus in an activity, with a sense of control and high motivation\u2014has been identified as a measure of this experience during physiological birth. This study aimed to discover whether one\u2010on\u2010one continuous professional support would improve the childbirth experience by increasing the likelihood of physiological birth and a heightened state of flow during childbirth. Methods Women with childbirth experience were recruited through social media. Participants (n\u2009=\u2009788) completed an online survey: the Flow State Scale (FSS) and a demographic questionnaire, including details about the professional support received during childbirth. Results One\u2010on\u2010one professional support was significantly associated with natural childbirth (midwife: 80.9%, doula: 65.7%) and lower medical interventions (midwife: 19.1%, doula: 34.3%) compared to conventional professional assistance (natural birth: 44.4%, interventions: 55.6%). A MANCOVA analysis revealed significant differences in flow state levels, with women receiving one\u2010on\u2010one support experiencing the highest flow state. Conclusions This research validates the significant correlation between one\u2010on\u2010one support\u2014provided by midwives or doulas\u2014and physiological birth. It also establishes for the first time a correlation between women in childbirth receiving continuous one\u2010on\u2010one professional support and heightened flow state levels, signifying a positive and empowering birthing experience.",

Methods Convenience sampling was used to conduct a questionnaire survey on 388 football players. Use Profile of Mood State (POMS), Smooth Experience Scale-2 (SES-2), Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), and Achievement Motivation Scale (AMS) to evaluate the Mood, Sport Flow State, Psychological Resilience, and Achievement Motivation in Competition of football players. Pearson correlation analysis and mediation analysis were used to investigate the relationship between the four variables of Mood, Sport Flow State, Psychological Resilience, and Achievement Motivation in Competition among football players. Results Football players\u2019 mood has a negative impact on Sport Flow State, Psychological Resilience, and Achievement Motivation In Competition, while Sport Flow State, Psychological Resilience, and Achievement Motivation In Competition have a mutually positive impact. Psychological Resilience has a positive impact on Achievement Motivation in Competition.

However, the effectiveness of such features on students\u2019 flow state necessitates further investigation as the existing literature has presented conflicting findings. Students\u2019 cultural differences may be a contributing factor to these inconsistent results, but this aspect has received little attention in previous studies. To address this research gap, the present study examines how the personalization feature in educational games and students\u2019 cultural differences affect students\u2019 flow state. Results showed that the flow state was not influenced by either the personalization game feature or cultural differences. Gender was found to affect cultural differences in terms of attitudes toward time and perceptions of role distribution between genders. However, these cultural differences did not have an impact on students\u2019 flow state during gameplay. Furthermore, a moderate correlation was observed between the flow state and the combined effect of the personalization game feature and cultural differences produced by gender. The findings provided explanations for why some studies reported a positive impact of the personalization feature on students\u2019 flow state while others did not.",

In order to better understand personal traits and states in athletes and individuals in high-physical-risk and sustained focus performance domains, this study examined baseline resilience levels, performance strategies used in specific competitions, and the flow state of event riders in those same competitions. The objective was to determine if performance strategies employed by elite three-day eventing athletes were related to baseline resilience and flow state characteristics, and if baseline resilience levels were related to levels of flow state within the group. Participants included 94 international level three-day eventing athletes (15 males, 78 females, 1 undisclosed; age 31.5 \u00b1 8.85) competing in the United States in the Spring 2021 Fe\u0301de\u0301ration Equestre International eventing season. Results demonstrated a modest but significant correlation (, ) between baseline resilience levels (measured by the CD-RISC-10) and flow state (measured by the Flow Short Scale) for all athletes. Performance strategies were measured by the Test of Performance Strategies (TOPS). Regression analyses indicated that the performance strategies subscales of emotional control and negative thinking were found to predict flow state (, , ). The sub-scales of goal setting, automaticity, emotional control, and self-talk predicted resilience (, , ). No significant findings emerged between an athlete\u2019s highest level of experience and their resilience scores (, ) or flow scores (, ).

      "abstract": "This study examined green tea\u2019s effects on task performance, mental fatigue, workload, and flow experience. Twenty-two healthy young male participants (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD age\u2009=\u200921.86\u2009\u00b1\u20091.96 years, range\u2009=\u200918\u201326 years) completed two 5-min mental tasks (arithmetic and sequential digit search) under three beverage consumption conditions: no beverage (NONE), WATER, and TEA (green tea). In the WATER and TEA conditions, participants consumed 70\u2009mL of beverage three times during the session (total: 210\u2009mL). Subjective Fatigue Feelings was assessed before and after each condition, and subjective evaluations including NASA Task Load Index, Flow Experience Checklist, and Duration Judgment Ratio, were conducted after each task. Results showed no significant differences in task performance across conditions (p\u2009>\u20090.05, \u03b7\u00b2\u2009=\u20090.11 and \u03b7\u00b2\u2009=\u20090.02 for MATH and SDS tasks, respectively), likely due to ceiling effects (accuracy\u2009>\u200995%). In the TEA condition, arousal levels were maintained and no increase in mental fatigue was observed, unlike the other conditions. The flow state score in the TEA condition was significantly higher than that in other conditions (NONE vs TEA: p\u2009=\u20090.0009), and participants perceived shorter task duration (NONE vs TEA: p\u2009=\u20090.0016, WATER vs TEA: p\u2009=\u20090.0061). These effects were observed even with small amounts of beverage and short consumption periods, suggesting that habitual intake of low-dose green tea may enhance task engagement and flow experience in everyday tasks.",

      "abstract": "The Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard (RB) convection under the influence of thermal radiation holds paramount importance in both natural systems and engineering applications, like advanced energy storage systems, renewable energy conversion technologies, and high-efficiency power generation systems, etc. Remarkably, thermal radiation significantly modifies flow dynamics and heat transport in RB convection. In this paper, direct numerical simulations of two-dimensional radiative RB convection in a square cavity have been conducted within the range of Rayleigh number Ra\u2009=\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u2009105\u20135\u2009\u00d7\u2009109, Planck number Pl\u2009=\u20090.005\u20130.16, and optical thickness \u03c4\u2009=\u20090.01\u201350. By incorporating radiative heat transfer mechanisms into the classical buoyancy-driven convection framework, we elucidate the coupled effects of thermal radiation and fluid motion on heat transport efficiency and flow structure evolution. The simulation results reveal that thermal radiation imposes a stabilizing effect on the flow state of RB convection, promoting the transition from disordered chaotic flow to organized steady-state circulation. The impact of thermal radiation on convective heat transfer is complex and can be stratified into three distinct regimes, i.e., radiation-sensitive regime, transition regime, and buoyancy-dominated regime. The evolution of flow structures influenced by thermal radiation varies distinctly across different regimes, thereby exerting a profound influence on convective heat transfer. Conversely, the radiative and total heat transfer always decrease continuously with the attenuation of thermal radiation. These findings advance understanding of radiation-convection coupling in complex systems.",

While its benefits are well-documented, research on its neural basis remains emerging. EEG-based systems offer a practical approach to flow detection due to their simplicity and accessibility. Recent advancements in commercial EEG devices provide new opportunities for real-life flow detection, yet their potential remains underexplored. In this study, we analyzed 29 EEG recordings of participants playing a Tetris video game, utilizing data from a consumer-oriented EEG device to develop a low-channel method for detecting the flow state. After denoising the EEG signals, We applied the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the signals into sub-bands. From each sub-band, we extracted three entropy-based features: Slope Entropy, Distribution Entropy, and Spectral Entropy. The extracted features were subsequently fed into a Random Forest classifier using two cross-validation strategies: Random Sampling (RS) and Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO). The classifier demonstrated high accuracy, achieving a mean accuracy of 93% with Random Sampling validation. Additionally, the LOSO validation strategy yielded an 82% average accuracy across the dataset. These findings suggest that the proposed method is a promising approach for detecting the flow state in real-life applications",

      "abstract": "The flow phenomenon, achieving a heightened state of concentration, is characterized by an autotelic experience, which may reduce the perception of physical exertion during sports activities. It has been extensively documented in sports and is associated with exceptional performance. However, despite comprehensive descriptions of the autotelic experience in flow, the physiological mechanisms underlying flow remain elusive, limiting its reproducibility and broader application. This study aimed to elucidate the contribution of flow to the discrepancies between perceived exercise intensity and physiological intensity during endurance exercise using an exercise bike. We assessed specific conditions conducive to flow during endurance exercise on a bicycle ergometer. Flow states were evaluated using a shortened version of the Flow State Scale, whereas subjective perceptions of exercise intensity were measured using the Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE). Physiological responses were monitored by measuring heart rate (HR), oxygen consumption, breathing frequency, ventilation, and oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin levels for changes in cerebral oxygenation at the prefrontal cortex assessed using near-infrared spectroscopy. Participants were categorized into RPE alleviation and escalation groups to examine individual differences in perceived exertion. RPE changes significantly differed between the two groups (p\u2009=\u20090.0002), despite no significant difference in HR changes (p\u2009=\u20090.36). The discrepancy ratios between perceived and physiological exercise intensity also significantly differed between groups (p\u2009=\u20090.001) and were negatively correlated with flow state levels (r\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.56). These findings advance our understanding of the physiological and neurological correlates of flow states during physical activity, with potential applications extending beyond sports performance enhancement to domains such as education and arts.",

Flow states are marked by (a) a perceived balance of skills and challenge, (b) opportunities for intense concentration, (c) clear task goals, (d) feedback that one is succeeding at the task, (e) a sense of control, (f) a lack of self-consciousness, and (g) the perception that time passes more quickly (Egbert, 2003). The Japanese Flow State Scale (JFSS) is an instrument which was created specifically to measure flow states experienced during deliberate vocabulary study and is a working component of the first author's Doctor of Philosophy research project, which focuses on the deliberate study of vocabulary with augmented reality (AR) and physical word cards.

Research has suggested that this can lead to a happier and more fulfilling life. This study used interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) to understand art students\u2019 experiences of flow while making art and to acknowledge any emotional responses they have to this experience. Semi-structured interviews (conducted in 2021) were used to gain an enriched understanding of flow in six art students. The analysis found that all participants experienced flow while making art, and this experience was incredibly similar for all participants. In addition, no emotions were reported while the participants were in the flow state, yet positive emotions were associated with the experience of flow afterward. Interestingly, the participants reported negative emotions toward art without flow, suggesting that flow could be the incentive for wanting to produce art. These findings point to the importance of flow for experiencing happiness, and, unlike previous research, suggest that flow states can play a role in the motivation to make art. Future research should attempt to replicate these finding using other qualitative methods, such as event sampling, and explore the flow state in other activities.",

      "abstract": "This research explores the impact of TikTok usage among higher education students, focusing on three dimensions: addiction, flow state, and sense of belonging. Recognising the significant role that TikTok plays in young people's digital lives, the study aims to analyse how this platform affects students at a Portuguese School of Higher Education according to these dimensions, thus contributing to a deeper understanding of the effects associated with its use. A mixed methodology was adopted, combining quantitative and qualitative methods. A sample of 125 students answered a questionnaire, and structured interviews were conducted with 6 participants. The questionnaire included specific scales to measure the flow state, sense of belonging, and signs of addiction related to TikTok usage. The interviews provided a deeper exploration of individual perceptions of the platform's impact on their lives. The results reveal that students frequently experience the flow state when using TikTok, reporting that time \"flies\" and that they become deeply absorbed by the content. Despite this, according to quantitative data collected, most do not consider themselves addicted to the platform. However, during the interviews, students acknowledged that TikTok can be addictive, admitting to spending more time than intended and losing track of time, suggesting a discrepancy between initial self-assessment and more in-depth reflection. Regarding the sense of belonging, most students do not feel part of the TikTok community, which may be attributed to their predominantly passive use of the platform and lack of interaction or content creation. This indicates that building a sense of belonging is linked to more active and interactive participation patterns. It is concluded that TikTok has a significant impact on higher education students, inducing flow states and potentially contributing to addictive behaviours. The absence of a sense of belonging suggests that passive usage does not foster a sense of community, which may affect how students relate to the platform and other users. These results have important implications for understanding the impact of social media on young people's well-being and mental health, highlighting the need to promote balanced and mindful usage. Future studies may focus on designing strategies aimed at mitigating potential negative effects deriving from the addictive use of this sort of technology and explore the role of content creation as a way of fostering a sense of belonging.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the relationship between perfectionist thinking, flow state, and leisure satisfaction levels among exercise participants. The scores related to these variables were analyzed based on gender and gym membership status. The sample consisted of 238 exercise participants, including 139 women (age=27.08\u00b18.79) and 99 men (age=25.79\u00b16.82), determined using a convenience sampling method. Participants engaged in fitness, pilates, swimming, zumba, fencing, football, and running activities. Data was collected using a personal information form, the Perfectionist Thinking Scale, the Dispositional Flow State Scale, and the Leisure Satisfaction Scale. For data analysis, descriptive statistical analyses were conducted, followed by Pearson\u2019s product-moment correlation to reveal relationships between variables, and independent samples t-tests to examine differences based on gender and gym membership status. The results indicated a significant relationship between perfectionist thinking, flow state, and leisure satisfaction (r=.627, p.01). A moderate positive relationship was found between perfectionist thinking and flow state \u00a0(r=.307, p.01), and a low positive relationship between perfectionist thinking and leisure satisfaction (r=.297, p.01). Gender differences were observed in perfectionist thinking (t=-2.006, p.05) and flow state (t=-2.664, p.05), while no significant difference was found in leisure satisfaction (t=.013, p.05). Gym membership status did not result in significant differences in perfectionist thinking scores (t=-.462, p.05), but significant differences were found in flow state (t=2.258, p.05) and leisure satisfaction (t=1.999, p.05). Overall, the findings demonstrate that perfectionist thinking is associated with somewhat more positive exercise-related experiences, mainly through a moderate relationship with flow state and a weaker relationship with leisure satisfaction.Keywords: Leisure Satisfaction, Flow State, Perfectionist Thinking.",

The values of linear component coefficient a and nonlinear component coefficient b obtained by nonlinear fitting by using Forchheimer\u2019s law decrease with the increase of percent air voids, and the values of the coefficients of specimens formed by rotary compaction molding are larger than those formed by Marshall compaction molding. The critical flow velocity and critical Reynolds number increase with the increase of percent air voids before and after triaxial fatigue loading with different molding methods.",

      "abstract": "Flow is a key indicator for deep immersive state. Current methods for detecting flow often rely on intrusive physiological devices (e.g EEG, HRV), requiring specialized equipment and complex data processing, with no capability for real-time flow state visualization. These limitations hinder the possibility to analyze the relationship between game settings and flow state fluctuations. To address this, we utilized an eye-tracking device (Tobii glasses) to record eye movement features in games under different flow states, creating a dataset to identify significant eye movement patterns correlated with flow state. Based on this, we developed a non-intrusive eye-tracking system that captures and analyzes specific eye features through a custom-designed algorithm, providing real-time feedback on flow states. Our system achieved a flow state detection accuracy of 85.3%, with a 412 ms detection delay, outperforming existing methods. This innovation offers a powerful tool for exploring the relationship between flow and game design, and further unlocking the biophysical mechanisms of flow.",

Since the broader focus in research was to independently evaluate mindfulness and flow in athletes, it is important to see the bridge between the two areas of study. Most reviewed articles showed significant correlation between mindfulness abilities and levels of flow in elite athletes.

      "abstract": "The detection and monitoring of oil\u2013gas\u2013water three-phase flow is highly demanded in oil\u2013gas well industry. Concentrating on combining the three substates of oil, gas, and water to form a holistic flow state, a monitoring framework based on graph-guided partial representation is proposed while maintaining linkage among flow states. In this framework, a differential pressure (DP)-pulse wave ultrasonic Doppler (PWUD) system is designed for obtaining information on the three-phase structure and the intrinsic relationships among different phases, so as to accurately characterize the substates of oil, gas, and water. Furthermore, within the unified paradigm of variational mode decomposition (VMD), standard VMD and reduced-order VMD (rVMD) are, respectively, utilized in the information mining of DP mode depicting 1-D flow fluctuations and PWUD mode representing 2-D spatiotemporal flow field. The time-varying nonstationarity of flow evolution is then quantified using statistical analysis. Based on converting flow data to flow features, graph guidance- and part-based nonnegative matrix factorizations (NMFs) are integrated to model and monitor the flow states in complicated oil\u2013gas\u2013water flow process. The proposed novel scheme about graph-guided partial representation-based horizontal oil\u2013gas\u2013water flow state monitoring via dual-modal detection is verified by dynamic experiments on a three-phase flow loop at Tianjin University.",

      "abstract": "This exploratory study aims to investigate the relationship between resting-state frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) and executive functions in adolescent video game players, while also examining potential associations between post-game FAA, in-game performance, and self-reported flow state. A total of 17 Dota 2\u2122 players and 21 CS:GO\u2122 players underwent EEG recordings before and immediately after a training match. FAA was calculated as the difference between the alpha power at frontal electrodes (F3 and F4). Executive functions were assessed via the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-2. Post-game data included the team game outcome (win or loss) and measures of flow state. The results revealed a significant positive association between relative left-sided frontal activity and behavioral regulation, and a tentative positive association between relative right-sided frontal activity and emotional regulation. Given the role of left-sided activity in emotional regulation, it may be assumed that regulatory control is selectively involved in suppressing impulsivity. The relationship between FAA and executive functions was inconsistent across recording conditions, highlighting a need for further methodological consideration of this issue. FAA was not associated with team performance or flow state. However, a positive trend emerged between FAA and autotelic experience. These findings challenge the existing literature linking success in sports, approach motivation, and positive emotions to left-frontal activity, highlighting the need for further investigation.",

      "abstract": "There is growing interest in exploring the positive effects of commercial video games for educational purposes. These investigations focus on enhancing learning outcomes but also on improving emotional and physical well-being, which may lead to greater motivation to learn and more positive learning experiences. However, few studies focus on the role of flow state in these phenomena. In line with this, we present two studies, the former conducted in a primary school in Northern Italy, and the latter in two secondary schools in Central Italy. Both of them aim to investigate the hidden effects of gaming at school in connection with the flow state. The first study, involving students from four classes, aimed at revealing collective dynamics unique to each class. The second study involved students from three classes of two different schools. This study investigated the peculiarity of the effects of different genres of games played in classes. We observed how flow state in context raised meaningful differences in some of the variables measured. These variations seem to reflect distinctive traits regarding playing in general and in the specifics of each class. These findings suggest that educators could consider the unique characteristics that gaming makes evident when designing educational strategies, potentially tailoring the learning process to better align with the specific dynamics of the context.",

      "abstract": "Gas-liquid two-phase flow is widely prevalent in industrial production. Because of safety and cost constraints, the lack of sufficient training samples for certain flow states in real industrial environments makes traditional data-driven flow state identification methods no longer feasible. To address this issue, a generative zero-shot learning model for industrial gas-liquid two-phase flow state identification is proposed. This approach leverages generative models to learn the relationship between semantic descriptions and data distributions, thereby enabling the recognition of invisible classes through the classifier trained by pseudo-data or pseudo-features generated through their semantic representations. In addition, for reducing the impact caused by domain shift problem when performing the generalized zero-shot learning task, the gating model is trained by using visible flow state samples and invisible flow state pseudo-samples to distinguish between the visible and invisible classes, so that recognition can be achieved respectively. Experiments were implemented on gas-liquid two-phase flow state data collected in the laboratory, and the results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "To meet the demand for high-achieving martial arts athletes in West Java, mental toughness and achievement goals are essential for athletes to achieve optimal performance. This study aims to investigate the influence of mental toughness and achievement goals on the flow state among martial arts athletes in West Java Province. The method used is quantitative with a causal design. The participants consisted of 158 athletes aged between 13 and 35 years, from various martial arts disciplines such as Pencak Silat, Taekwondo, Karate, and others. The data analysis methods used include normality tests, linearity tests, multiple regression analysis, coefficient of determination tests, and categorization tests. All data analyses were conducted using SPSS Statistics version 25.0. The instruments used in this study include the Flow State Scale (FSS), the Mental Toughness Index, and the 2 x 2 Achievement Goals Questionnaire. The regression analysis results show that mental toughness has a significant influence on the flow state, while achievement goals do not have a significant partial effect. However, simultaneously, both variables significantly influence the flow state, with a contribution of 59.8%. These findings emphasize the importance of mental strength and achievement-oriented behavior in shaping the optimal performance conditions of athletes during competition. This study is expected to serve as a foundation for the development of psychological training programs aimed at enhancing the performance of martial arts athletes by strengthening mental toughness and managing achievement goals to produce outstanding athletes.",

      "abstract": "Narrative media emerges its flow state model from a relationship between audience relatability and narrative continuity. When viewers engage with a story, their cognitive abilities and emotional investment interact with the coherence of the narrative, which determines the depth of immersion. Existing research highlights that textual cohesion, probabilistic continuity, and emotional transitions are key to sustaining flow when receiving stories through media. However, cultural background and audience familiarity with storytelling conventions also influence the interpretation of story content and, therefore, cause different degrees of immersive experiences. This study proposes a Two-Dimensional Flow Framework, categorizing factors for flow state into relatability\u2014how much the viewer identifies with the story\u2014and continuity\u2014the logical progression of the narrative. Misalignment in these dimensions can lead to disengagement through negative emotions. This framework allows creators to craft narratives that sustain audience engagement without overwhelming or under-stimulating them through curating the relationship between audience relatability and narrative continuity. The findings suggest that cognitive compatibility and emotional resonance deepen audience connection and sustained participation, so future storytellers should consider these factors when designing narrative media.",

      "abstract": "Survivors and refugees of war often have mental, behavioral, emotional, and spiritual consequences from undergoing civil unrest. In many cases, counselors utilize cognitively\u2010based therapies as the recommended treatment to alleviate these issues. While these methods do have relevance, other, more contemporary humanistic approaches also indicate tremendous promise. Flow state, which has connections to existential\u2010humanism, is one such method. Flow state is an internal process in which a person becomes completely immersed in an activity or goal where all else is inconsequential/irrelevant. The ability to consciously tap into flow allows individuals to attain a peak state, which allows for optimal experience and life enjoyment. This process is autotelic, which, operationally defined, means done simply for the sake of the activity or goal itself. The purpose of this article is to provide counselors with information on how to utilize flow with survivors and refugees of war in an existential\u2010humanistic approach.",

      "abstract": "Today, it is thought that the desire to achieve the ideal body image may have a negative impact on the possibility of engaging with exercise and experiencing positive emotions during exercise. Therefore, this study was designed to determine the role of objectified body consciousness, which affects positive mood and self-conscious thoughts in predicting leisure satisfaction, which has a major share in individuals\u2019 quality of life. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the dispositional flow state, objectified body consciousness, and leisure satisfaction scores among sports center members. The sample of the study consisted of 340 members of sports centers. According to the hierarchical regression analysis, objectified body consciousness significantly predicted leisure satisfaction and explained 4.2% of the variance in the participants\u2019 leisure satisfaction scores. It was found that the dispositional flow state, along with the contribution of objectified body consciousness, significantly predicted leisure satisfaction and explained 25.2% of the variance. It was determined that the combined variables of objectified body consciousness and dispositional flow state accounted for a total variance of 29.4% in leisure satisfaction. The results supported the proposition that objectified body consciousness associated with body surveillance may play a role in experiencing less of a positive emotional state defined as a dispositional flow state. In order to ensure that individuals spend their leisure time productively through regular exercise participation, it is important for sports center operators and instructors to plan activities that address individual needs and provide supportive environments.",

According to Csikszentmihalyi, flow is experienced similarly by everyone, regardless of gender, age, culture, or activity (Nakamura & Csikszentmihalyi, 2012). However, very few researchers have examined how the concept of flow is measured and experienced in the context of disability. More recently, disability has become a focus for research using the Flow State Scale-2, but psychometric data are lacking overall (Ottiger et al., 2021; Swaine et al. 2020). This study provides evidence that individuals with disabilities do experience components for flow and the Flow State Scale-2 may provide a valid method of capturing potential outcomes of adaptive sport and recreation programs.

      "abstract": "Previously, three yoga breathing practices showed varying short-term effects on heart rate variability (HRV) when studied separately. The present study assessed the effects of the three yoga breathing practices on HRV, respiration, and mood states in a randomized crossover design, compared to two control conditions. There were 42 participants (mean age 23.64 \u00b1 3.66 years, male:female ratio 1:1, with a mean of 43.62 \u00b1 33.04 months of yoga breathing experience). Five sessions (with 15 minutes of intervention) were conducted on separate days in random order: bumblebee yoga breathing, bellows yoga breathing, high-frequency yoga breathing, breath awareness (as an interventional control), and quiet rest (as a noninterventional control). HRV, blood pressure, and respiration were assessed before, during, and after each session, whereas mood state was assessed before and after each session. Repeated-measures analysis of variance and post hoc tests showed increased low-frequency power, with a mean breath rate of 4 breaths per minute in bumblebee yoga breathing (where breathing was very slow, deep, and inhalation was shorter than exhalation), whereas in bellows yoga breathing (deep breathing, inhalation longer than exhalation, and marginal slowing) the root mean square of successive differences increased. In contrast, during high-frequency yoga breathing (where breathing was rapid, deep, and inhalation was longer than exhalation) root mean square of successive differences decreased (all comparisons were with the preceding state; p < 0.05). Pleasant and positive mood states increased following bumblebee yoga breathing, while pleasant mood states increased and negative mood states decreased following breath awareness. Bumblebee yoga breathing and bellows yoga breathing appeared to increase vagally mediated HRV, whereas high-frequency yoga breathing reduced it. As the participants were yoga-experienced and only short-term effects were reported, generalizability of the results is limited to experienced practitioners and acute effects.",

      "abstract": "Patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN) often experience negative emotions and a decline in quality of life, conditions in which the neuro-endocrine-immune axis plays a crucial role. In this study, we explored the effects of an eight-week multimodal psychological intervention, incorporating cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness meditation, and relaxation training, on DN patients. Ninety participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group, a sham intervention group, or a control group. The sham intervention group received nonspecific contact of equivalent duration, while the control group received routine care only. Psychological outcomes were evaluated using HADS and SF-36 scales, and serum levels of cortisol, CRH, ACTH, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Bioinformatic analyses, including Gene Ontology/Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction network mapping, were employed to identify key molecular mechanisms. Results demonstrated that the intervention group exhibited significant improvements in emotional well-being and quality of life, accompanied by reductions in neuroendocrine hormones and inflammatory cytokines. Bioinformatic data further revealed the central role of IL-6 within the inflammatory regulatory network in DN. These findings suggest that multimodal psychological intervention can effectively improve psychological outcomes and inflammatory profiles in DN patients by targeting the neuro-endocrine-immune axis, with IL-6 acting as a pivotal mediator. This work provides novel evidence supporting the integration of psychological interventions into the management of DN and highlights IL-6 as a potential therapeutic target.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The AMORAL model emphasizes that adverse environments foster malevolent creativity. Parental technoference, as a adverse family environment characterized by the disruption of parent-child interpersonal interactions due to parents' use of digital technology, may be associated with malevolent creative behavior. In addition, parental technoference increases children's susceptibility to engaging in phubbing, which refers to prioritizing mobile device use over face-to-face interaction in social contexts. However, existing research has not thoroughly examined the direct association between parental technoference and malevolent creative behavior, nor have the underlying psychological mechanisms been adequately explored. To address this gap, the present study aims to investigate the relationship between parental technoference and malevolent creative behavior, the mediating role of phubbing in this association, and the moderating effect of mindfulness on this mediation. METHODS: A sample of 792 Chinese adolescents (mean age\u2009=\u200914.75 years, SD\u2009=\u20091.56) completed the Parental Technoference Scale, the Malevolent Creativity Behavior Scale, the Brief Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory, and the Phubbing Scale. RESULTS: Parental technoference positively correlated with malevolent creative behavior, and phubbing mediated the connection between parental technoference and malevolent creative behavior. Moreover, mindfulness moderated the indirect effect of the mediation model. Specifically, mindfulness mitigated the positive association between parental technoference and phubbing, while strengthening the positive relationship between phubbing and malevolent creative behavior. CONCLUSION: The higher parental technoference, the higher level of phubbing, which in turn boosted the tendency of malevolent creative behavior. This indirect relationship was moderated by mindfulness, such that individuals with higher levels of mindfulness were more effective in buffering the adverse effects of phubbing arising from parental technoference, while also demonstrating an increased tendency toward malevolent creative behavior as a consequence of phubbing.",
