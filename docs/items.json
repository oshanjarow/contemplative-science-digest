      "abstract": "Due to the occupational characteristics of clinical work, nurses often face many challenges related to physical and psychological health. Mindfulness-based interventions are psychological intervention therapies based on mindfulness, which has been proven to effectively improve burnout, resilience and sleep quality among nurses. But there is not sufficient evidence to examine the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions on burnout, resilience and sleep quality among nurses. To evaluate the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions in reducing burnout, resilience and sleep quality among nurses and enhance the quality of nursing medical service. Seven electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure were searched from their inception to November, 2024. Randomized controlled trials investigated the effects of mindfulness-based interventions for improving burnout, resilience and sleep quality among nurses. The quality of the included studies was assessed by the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool v2. Meta-analyses were conducted using Review Manager 5.4 and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence. A total of 4622 studies were initially retrieved and 16 articles (n\u2009=\u20091384 individuals) were included. The meta-analysis showed that mindfulness-based interventions could effectively improve burnout (SMD = -1.43, 95% CI: -1.94 to \u2212\u20090.92, P\u2009<\u20090.001), resilience (MD\u2009=\u20099.78, 95% CI: 0.38 to 19.17, P\u2009=\u20090.04) and sleep quality (SMD = -1.1, 95% CI: -1.79 to -0.41, P\u2009=\u20090.002). However, due to some moderate risk of bias and high level of heterogeneity, the overall quality of the evidence was not high. Mindfulness-based interventions could improve burnout, resilience and sleep quality among nurses. This suggests that mindfulness-based interventions can provide preliminary clinical practice support for addressing mental health and well-being and work quality of nurses. But because of moderate to low certainty of evidence and some concerns of bias, more rigorous studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions for improving the outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Military personnel face an increased risk of developing mental disorders owing to the stressful environments they encounter. Effective stress management strategies are crucial to mitigate this risk. Mindfulness training (MT) is promising as a stress management approach in such demanding settings. This study uses a quantitative approach to investigate the impact of MT on the relationship between the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and emotional regulation. The study evaluated the effectiveness of MT in reducing stress among 86 military personnel. Participants were divided into two groups: MT (n = 42) and non-MT (n = 38). The study compared the two groups using measures of heart rate variability (HRV), a reliable indicator of ANS activity. The MT group exhibited a significant increase in HRV (14.4%, p = 0.001) and alpha asymmetry (AA) in the frontal lobe (45.7%, p < 0.001) compared to the non-MT group. Notably, the MT group achieved significantly higher scores on the parachute landing fall (PLF) training performance (p < 0.001). These improvements in HRV, AA, and PLF performance were strongly correlated. Furthermore, AA fully mediated the relationship between HRV and PLF training performance. The findings suggest that MT has a positive impact on stress resilience, potentially by mitigating anxiety and attention deficits induced by extreme stressors. These positive effects are facilitated by concurrent modulation of the frontal cortex and autonomic nervous system. Our findings provide insight into the neural mechanisms behind MT-induced stress reduction from the perspective of neuromodulation.",

      "abstract": "Buddhist meditation and mindfulness practices have garnered global recognition for their significant contributions to mental health and overall well-being. This study examines the potential of these ancient techniques as effective tools for lifelong learning. Grounded in the rich traditions of Buddhism, meditation and mindfulness extend beyond mere stress reduction, fostering heightened awareness, concentration, and emotional regulation skills essential for continuous personal and professional development. Mindfulness practice entails sustaining moment-by- moment awareness of thoughts, emotions, bodily sensations, and the external environment. This enhanced awareness cultivates cognitive flexibility, resilience, and creativity, which are particularly valuable in an era characterized by rapid technological advancements and continuous change. Similarly, meditation practices such as Vipassana (insight meditation) and Samatha (calm meditation) nurture inner peace, compassion, and mental equilibrium, thereby enhancing an individual's capacity for learning and adaptation. This paper argues that the integration of Buddhist meditation and mindfulness into educational frameworks has the potential to transform the learning process. By fostering a mindful approach to learning, individuals can improve focus, alleviate anxiety, and enhance memory retention. Moreover, these practices encourage a reflective learning style, enabling learners to engage deeply with academic material and derive meaningful insights.",

Actually, the Om Jap Dhyan is virtual program running in the evening time since 2019 A.D in covid time conducted by Om Jap Dhyan Samiti under the guidance of Patanjali Yog Samiti Lumbini Pradesh, Nepal. It includes three types of meditations and the same number of Sutras of Rishi Patanjali's Yog Darshan. The 27th Sutra of Samadhi Pad \"Tasyavachakahpranavah\" is named as Om Chanting Meditation, 35th sutra of Samadhi Pad \u201cVishayavativa Pravritti Utpannamanasah Sthitini Bandhani\u201d is named as Music Meditation and 51st Sutra of Sadhanpada B\u0101hy\u0101bhyantara-Vi\u1e63aya-\u0100k\u1e63ep\u012bcaturtha\u1e25\" is named as Pran Meditation. This study investigates the impact of Om Jap Dhyan on anxiety level among elderly peoples, focusing on 25 males and 25 females\u2019 participants aged 50 to 70 years. Using a pre-post research design, they are divided into two groups: males and females. Both groups are engaged daily in evening time for Om Jap Dhyan practice continuously in one month altogether 40 minutes in which Om Chanting meditation for 20 minutes, Music Meditation for 10 minutes and Pran Meditation for 10 minutes. Anxiety levels are measured before and after the intervention using Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS). The results reveals significant reductions in anxiety for both genders, with experiencing a greater decrease in males compared to females. Statistical analysis showed highly significant t-values (male group: t = 12.685, female group: t = 9.950) and significance levels (p< 0.001) for both groups. The quantitative analysis suggests that Om Jap Dhyan is an effective method for reducing anxiety in elderly peoples and highlights its potential as a complementary therapy to conventional treatments.",

This qualitative case study investigates the role of Buddhist education at Wat Prey Speu Buddhist Primary School, exploring how it integrates traditional precepts within the national curriculum. Thematic analysis was used to interpret data from in-depth interviews with 59 stakeholders, including students, teachers, and administrators. The findings reveal the school's primary strength is its holistic approach, which develops students' moral conduct (S\u012bla), concentration (Sam\u0101dhi), and wisdom (Pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101). The institution also plays a vital role in preserving Khmer culture and providing affordable education to underserved communities. Key recommendations include formalizing the curriculum, addressing a significant gender imbalance, and seeking formal recognition and support from the Ministry of Education to promote this valuable educational model.",

All the four components of health i.e., Physical, Psychological, Social and Spiritual enhancement observed through yoga. Asta Pada (eight limb) namely Yama, Niyam, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyan and Samadhi are found in different classics. Even getting Moksha or liberation is an ultimate goal yet earlier step like Yama, Niyama, Asana and Pranayama are extremely beneficial for maintaining normal health. Among all 8 limbs Yoga Asanas are mainly related to clinical and therapeutic aspect. Improvement of muscle tone, muscle power and increase range of motion are noted in Yogasana.

      "abstract": "Han Kang's The White Book (2016) redefines trauma narratives through Eastern meditative traditions, particularly the yogic concepts of \u2018dharana\u2019 (concentration) and \u2018dharana\u2019 (meditative absorption). The novel's structure, symbolism, and fragmented prose mirror these meditative stages, offering a literary model for processing grief and engaging with collective mourning. The narrator begins with an intense focus on her deceased sister's absence, using whiteness\u2014represented by objects like swaddling bands, snow, and salt\u2014as a focal point (\u2018dharana\u2019). This disciplined concentration anchors her mourning in a structured, ritualistic act of remembrance. As the narrative progresses, this focused contemplation expands beyond personal grief into an immersive meditation on mortality, impermanence, and renewal (dhyana). This transition reflects a shift from individual sorrow to a broader existential awareness, dissolving boundaries between self and collective memory. In parallel, Bracha L. Ettinger's (2006) concept of wit(h)nessing reframes witnessing trauma as an ethical, intersubjective process rather than a detached observation. The novel's sparse and fragmented prose, combined with deliberate white spaces, invites readers to engage actively in the mourning process, transforming reading into a participatory act of remembrance. By integrating Eastern meditative philosophy with poetic storytelling and ethical engagement, The White Book challenges conventional trauma narratives, positioning literature as a space for healing, reflection, and communal memory. This study argues that Kang's work reconfigures how trauma is represented in literature, and offers a transformative framework for understanding grief as a shared and meditative process",

      "abstract": "Meditation, especially Alpha-Power Activation Yoga (APAY), is popular today for well-being. Apay promotes relaxation and focuses using yoga and attention. However, the inspiring settings app effectiveness evaluation made challenging. EEG can measure attentive brain activity. This work improves the Alfa EEG pattern analysis for the discovery of EFEM. EEG functions are classified through the moral analysis and machine learning of the time. This approach reflects the neurological attention process. Preliminary research found that alpha-EEG patterns change with training stages such as concentration, attentive absorption and relaxation. Deep concentration reduces hiking and increases frontal and lateral regions. Constant attention increases front and behind alpha, suggests brain treatment and sensory awareness. This shows that app-inspired attention requires more EEG study to understand neurophysiology. Strong EEG biomarker will track skill changes and its mental health benefits. Kaggle EEG Alpha Wave Dataset detects meditation (closes the eyes) with non-meditation (opening of the eyes) when relaxing the subject. In this dataset, the decisions identify accurately the trees in the decision, innocent bays and random forest phenomena. These findings will be repeated in a large population and investigated to see how the monkey practice affects psychological and neurological processes over time. Researchers can identify brainwave patterns and emotional welfare connections and explain these results. It can inspire new attention -based mental health treatments. Doctors can provide better mental and emotional care by adding these techniques to parting to the treatment. A full disposition goal is to improve the awareness of welfare and body. This can show how diet and exercise affect mental health.",

      "abstract": "This article discusses three important concepts of ancient Indian discourse, namely absence, nothingness and emptiness, and examines their representations in Therav\u0101da Buddhism. Firstly, it overviews the early Indian records of the concept of absence and then focuses on the role of absence in Therav\u0101da Buddhism. It shows how the ethical foundations of the Buddhist path to liberation from suffering are largely expressed through the absence of unethical behaviour, and how meditation practice involves the cultivation of mental states that are based on the absence of unwholesome mental factors. The article then discusses specific higher states of meditative absorption, as presented in the canonical and postcanonical P\u0101li sources, which include experiences of infinite space, infinite consciousness, and nothingness, the latter being articulated as the absence of anything at all. According to the Therav\u0101da tradition, the experience of nothingness, which is perceived as complete absence, devoid of any phenomena, is not considered final liberation, because it still involves perception, feeling and other mental components and thus remains in the sphere of impermanence. Only in the state of ultimate emptiness of nibb\u0101na (Sanskrit nirv\u0101\u1e47a) is complete liberation from suffering reached. The realization of nibb\u0101na is presented as the very foundation of a deep transformation of consciousness, reflected in the partial or complete absence of fetters, defined as phenomena that bind living beings to suffering. In summary, the article shows how, in Therav\u0101da Buddhism, absence plays the central role in the cultivation of moral virtue and meditation, including the experience of nothingness, and how the realization of the emptiness of nibb\u0101na, regarded as the final liberation from suffering, is reflected in the concomitant ethical perfection.\u00a0",

      "abstract": "Emotional intelligence, encompassing self-awareness, emotional regulation, empathy, motivation, and social skills, is essential for personal and professional growth. Ancient practices like meditation, rooted in Indian traditions, have been recognized for their potential to enhance emotional intelligence by fostering emotional and psychological balance. Among these practices, Amrit Varsha Dhyan, introduced by Pandit Shriram Sharma Acharya, emerges as a unique meditative approach emphasizing emotional harmony through guided visualization techniques. Amrit Varsha Dhyan involves visualizing the absorption of \"Amrit\" (divine nectar) to cleanse emotions, reduce stress, and cultivate positive thought patterns and behaviors. \nThis paper explores the foundational evidence linking Amrit Varsha Dhyan with the development of emotional intelligence. Through practices like guided imagery and visualization, Amrit Varsha Dhyan is believed to enhance self-awareness, emotional resilience, empathy, and social skills, contributing to holistic well-being. Empirical studies also highlight Amrit Varsha Dhyan's role in reducing anxiety, fostering emotional stability, and improving mental clarity. This study explores the potential of Amrit Varsha Dhyan as a structured meditation practice for cultivating emotional intelligence and promoting overall mental health.",

      "abstract": "The new millennium is witnessing a remarkable shift within the scientific community, to be increasingly understanding and accepting the impact of meditative, spiritual, and even religious practices, on health and wellbeing. This has been precipitated ironically, by cutting edge scientific studies. Rigorous empirical research in epigenomics and neuroscience is proving that religious and spiritual experiences impact psychology and physiology. Therapeutic and prophylactic benefits from spiritual meditative practices (SMPs) are now proven for a variety of chronic conditions, notably in mental health wellness. While all forms of SMPs are currently being investigated, those from the Islamic tradition are lagging behind interrogation of similar SMPs from other traditions, such as mindfulness. Traditional Islamic SMPs have remained largely hidden or misunderstood, and as yet poorly translated into the modern context. In this paper we situate Islamic SMPs in the context of how they impact mental health and wellbeing, explaining their breadth and depth. We highlight the efficacy of dhikr and Quran recitation therapies as treatments for addiction and anxiety, noting historic evidence, and discuss how they may be integrated into modern mental health treatments. A millennium and a half of historical data proves their efficacy as psychotherapy. Precedent for the use of Islamic SMPs to treat mental illness for all people regardless of faith exists, highlighting their potential for wide implementation today. Of the Islamic SMPs that can most easily be accessed by modern people, listening to Quranic recitation and forms of dhikr therapy are notable for their ease of administration and strikingly uniform positive results. More rigorous empirical studies are called for to better translate Islamic SMPs into modern complimentary and alternative medicine, as they hold great promise as universally adoptable cogent modern psychotherapies.",

However, due to their structural characteristics, they often exhibit low bioavailability in vivo. In this review, we focus on the in vivo study of flavonoids, particularly the effects of gut microbiome on flavonoids, including common modifications such as methylation, acetylation, and dehydroxylation, etc. These modifications aim to change the structural characteristics of the original substances to enhance absorption and bioavailability. In order to improve the bioavailability of flavonoids, we discuss two feasible methods, namely dosage form modification and chemical modification, and hope that these approaches will offer new insights into the application of flavonoids for human health. In this article, we also introduce the types, plant sources, and efficacy of flavonoids. In conclusion, this is a comprehensive review on how to improve the bioavailability of flavonoids.",

      "abstract": "Electromagnetic pollution protection and military stealth technologies underscore the urgent need to develop efficient electromagnetic wave-absorbing materials (EWAMs). Traditional EWAMs suffer from single absorption loss mechanisms, poor impedance matching, and weak reflection loss. To date, combining dielectric loss with magnetic loss in EWAMs have proven to be an effective approach to enhancing electromagnetic absorption performance. The structural design of composites plays a pivotal role in improving impedance matching and enhancing the attenuation of electromagnetic waves. It is widely regarded as one of the principal methods for fine-tuning electromagnetic parameters and response mechanisms. Among these, composites of carbon and magnetic materials have become a research hotspot due to their magnetoelectric synergistic effects and versatile microstructure design. Herein, the principles of electromagnetic wave absorption in terms of both the loss mechanism and impedance matching are outlined. The research progress on core-shell, skeleton, and hollow structure of carbon/magnetic composite EWAMs are summarized. The synthesis methods, absorption properties, and attenuation mechanisms of composites with these structures are described in detail. Finally, the limitations of carbon/magnetic composites in electromagnetic wave absorption are discussed, possible solutions are proposed, and future development directions for carbon/magnetic composite EWAMs are envisioned.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used non-invasive method to explore brain activity and cognitive states, including the effects of meditation. The potential of prenatal EEG to understand the neural mechanisms underlying maternal brain activity makes it an exciting field of study. However, research on prenatal EEG during different stages of meditation is currently lacking. Additionally, feature map generation and selection remain tedious and time-intensive, requiring careful identification of relevant features to capture both linear and non-linear insights from EEG data. Methods: This paper proposes a Tetra Feature Map (TFM) for analyzing prenatal EEG signals, enabling effective differentiation of meditative states. TFM integrates four key aspects of the data: frequency bands, time domains, statistical features, and entropy features along with geometrical features facilitating a comprehensive analysis of dynamic EEG behavior. The PEM-43 dataset was used to evaluate TFM, tested across 33 machine learning classifiers to assess its performance in categorizing different meditative states. Results: The study revealed that TFM achieved a test accuracy of 92%. Furthermore, TFM was compared with two other feature sets, the Statistical Feature Map (SFM) and the New Feature Map (NFM), which achieved classification accuracies of 88% and 89%, respectively. TFM demonstrated superior performance in classification accuracy. Conclusion: These findings indicate that TFM can effectively analyze prenatal EEG data with a high classification success rate. This marks a significant advancement in prenatal EEG research and its application in brain state classification, particularly in the context of meditation.",

      "abstract": "Aerospace vehicles and electronic devices are often operated in elevated temperature environments, which has led to an increased demand for high\u2010temperature microwave absorbing materials (MAMs). The microwave absorption properties of MAMs are influenced not only by the intrinsic material characteristics but also by the micro\u2010, meso\u2010, and macro\u2010structural configurations of the composites. This paper reviews recent advancements in high\u2010temperature MAMs through a multiscale design approach. Due to the temperature sensitivity of permittivity, MAMs tend to exhibit microwave reflection behavior at elevated temperatures. Strategies aimed at regulating conductivity and polarization behavior can enhance impedance matching under these conditions; however, this often results in an unavoidable reduction in loss capability. In contrast to traditional design methodologies, MAMs constructed from subwavelength\u2010scale functional units can achieve remarkable anti\u2010reflection effects through discrete unit distribution, thereby significantly optimizing both dielectric loss capacity and impedance matching. Furthermore, the equivalent electromagnetic parameters of metacomposites are intrinsically linked to their physical properties and structural attributes. This relationship offers a novel strategy for enhancing high\u2010temperature microwave absorption performance. It is anticipated that this review will provide insightful guidance for future explorations into innovative and highly efficient high\u2010temperature MAMs.",

      "abstract": "Aerogels with porous structures offer an attractive approach to modulating electromagnetic parameters and enhancing electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption performance. However, conventional aerogels are limited by their single-scale pore size and fixed orientation, which constrain their EMW absorption capabilities. This study introduces aerogels with dual-scale pores and dual-network structure constructed via constant-temperature freezing and secondary-infusion freezing method. Multiscale aerogels with both micrometer- and submillimeter-scale pores are constructed when the Ti3C2Tx MXene and thermoplastic polyurethane solution is frozen and dried at a specific temperature, leading to an ultra-wide effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) reaching 10.41\u00a0GHz in the vertical direction. Furthermore, to address the poor EMW absorption in the parallel direction, a secondary infusion freezing method is applied to form an aerogel with a dual-network structure, which forms reflective interfaces perpendicular to the incident EMW in various directions. This adjustment enhances the EAB in the parallel direction from 1.58 to 5.93\u00a0GHz, marking a 275.32% enhancement, while the EAB in the vertical incident direction reaches 8.08\u00a0GHz. This design strategy overcomes the limitations of structural scale and arrangement direction, enriching the attenuation mechanisms of the absorber, while effectively reducing sensitivity to the direction of incoming EMW, offering new insights for designing efficient EMW absorbers.",

The layered arrangement and gradient distribution of magnetic MXene are firstly combined to improve the electromagnetic wave (EMW) RLmin and broaden effective absorption bandwidth. Absorption, reflection, and transmission (A\u2013R\u2013T) power coefficient analysis is firstly used to guide the gradient distribution, so as to realize EMW incidence at low-concentration surface, loss at middle concentration interlayer and reflection at high-concentration bottom. The layered gradient composite (LG5-10-15) achieves complete absorption coverage of X-band at thickness of 2.00-2.20 mm with RLmin of -68.67 dB. The morphological distribution of absorbent in composites is equally important with absorbents for the overall electromagnetic properties, but it is often ignored. Herein, a comprehensive consideration including electromagnetic component regulation, layered arrangement structure, and gradient concentration distribution was used to optimize impedance matching and enhance electromagnetic loss. On the microscale, the incorporation of magnetic Ni nanoparticles into MXene nanosheets (Ni@MXene) endows suitable intrinsic permittivity and permeability. On the macroscale, the layered arrangement of Ni@MXene increases the effective interaction area with electromagnetic waves, inducing multiple reflection/scattering effects. On this basis, according to the analysis of absorption, reflection, and transmission (A\u2013R\u2013T) power coefficients of layered composites, the gradient concentration distribution was constructed to realize the impedance matching at low-concentration surface layer, electromagnetic loss at middle concentration interlayer and microwave reflection at high-concentration bottom layer. Consequently, the layered gradient composite (LG5-10\u201315) achieves complete absorption coverage of X-band at thickness of 2.00\u20132.20 mm with RLmin of \u221268.67 dB at 9.85 GHz in 2.05 mm, which is 199.0%, 12.6%, and 50.6% higher than non-layered, layered and layered descending gradient composites, respectively. Therefore, this work confirms the importance of layered gradient structure in improving absorption performance and broadens the design of high-performance microwave absorption materials.",

Here, by integrating the highly conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs) networks and the temperature\u2010stable silicon nitride (Si3N4) protective layer, a CNTs/amorphous carbon@Si3N4 (C\u2010CNT\u2010Si3N4) porous foam composed of sandwich\u2010like Si3N4/C\u2010CNT/Si3N4 strut, which exhibits excellent temperature\u2010insensitive electromagnetic\u2010absorbing properties from room temperature to 600 \u00b0C, is demonstrated. To be specific, the value of the minimum reflection loss is always lower than \u221250 dB, and a temperature\u2010insensitive effective absorbing bandwidth covering the whole X band throughout a thickness range of 4.8\u20136.1 mm is achieved. The superior temperature\u2010insensitive electromagnetic\u2010absorbing property is due to the synergistic effects of irregular polarization loss derived from lattice vacancies and heterogeneous interface, slightly increased conductive loss derived from decreasing carrier mobility, and increasing carrier concentration under a rising temperature environment.",

This article proposes a three-step approach to improving the energy system management of an industrial plant. The first phase involves the identification of hot surfaces in electrical panels using nondestructive instrumentation for thermographic measurements. The second phase develops an electronic system consisting of current sensors and a temperature control system, a control unit made with Raspberry Pi integrated with Arduino, and a data transmission system using a 4G LTE Internet device capable of measuring the electrical current used by a machine in the plant. The electronic system measures current absorption (CA) by the lines of the electrical switchboards. The final phase focuses on the implementation of deep learning (DL) method based on the integration of a long short-term memory (LSTM) model for the forecasting of hourly CA and a U-Net model for supporting the classification and detection of anomalies identified during thermographic assessment. The results demonstrated substantial improvements in the accuracy of power consumption classification and the potential to optimize power distribution and reduce consumption accordingly. This classification results in reduced energy consumption and improved process quality.",

      "abstract": "Long-wave infrared (LWIR) broadband absorption is of great significance in science and technology. The electromagnetic field energy is absorbed by the metamaterials material, leading to the enhanced light absorption, from which the Metal\u2013Dielectric\u2013Metal (MDM) structure is designed. FDTD simulation calculation indicate that the bandwidth within which the absorber absorption ratio greater than 90% is 11.04 \u03bcm, and the average absorption rate (9.10~20.14 \u03bcm) is 93.6%, which can be accounted for by the impedance matching theory. Upon the matching of the impedance of the metamaterial absorber with the impedance of the incident light, the light reflection is reduced to a minimum, and increase the absorption ratio. Meanwhile, the good incidence angle unsensitivity due to the metasurface structural symmetry and the characteristics of the electromagnetic field distribution at different incidence angles. Due to the form regularity of the nanoring\u2013nanowire metasurface structure, the light acts similar in different polarization directions, and the surface plasmon resonance plays a key role. Using FDTD electromagnetic field analysis to visualize the electric field and magnetic field strength distribution within the absorber, the electromagnetic field at the interface in the nanoring\u2013nanowire metasurface structure, promote the surface plasmon resonance and interaction with damaged materials, and improve the light absorption efficiency. Moreover, the different microstructures and the electrical and optical properties of different top materials affect the light absorption. Meanwhile, adjusting the absorption layer thickness and periodic geometry parameters will also change the absorption spectrum. The absorber has high practical value in thermal electronic devices, infrared imaging, and thermal detection.",

An article on fractals and consciousness1 proposes a theoretical link between consciousness and fractal processes, suggesting inherent limitations in modeling consciousness. An article on religious practice2 presents a study on the neurophysiological and biological effects of chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo, revealing specific sound frequencies, increased prefrontal cortex activity, and enhanced microbial metabolism. An article on ultraweak photon emission3 describes changes in emission patterns during meditation, suggesting influence on metabolic processes. Complementing these, a new observational study4 explores correlations between chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo and subtle variations in local natural radioactivity, reporting higher detected counts and increased variability during chanting periods, aligning conceptually with consciousness influencing random physical systems (e.g., PEAR, GCP). The commentary interprets Gardiner's fractal concepts through the lens of chanting effects, suggesting links between fractal brain activity and chanting, and connects ultraweak photon emission results to neural and metabolic changes. Furthermore, it integrates the radioactivity findings as another empirical layer, suggesting potential correlations between the focused state of chanting and subtle physical effects on the environment. While acknowledging limitations like single-subject or small sample sizes and the need for further studies, the commentary underscores the interdisciplinary nature of consciousness research and the potential for convergent findings across diverse methodologies, including neurophysiology, biophysics, and environmental measurements, in understanding the profound effects of meditative and religious practices.",

The paper argues that reading scriptures parallels the structural features of mindfulness practice, enabling practitioners to focus on the present moment and accept internal emotions, thereby promoting mental and physical well-being. Scriptural reading encompasses both concentrative and insight meditation, incorporating psychological mechanisms that facilitate emotional healing, self-regulation, and the cultivation of compassion. Based on this perspective, the study proposes that scriptural reading may serve as a meaningful contemplative practice applicable in various domains of modern life, including education, counseling, and personal development. However, as the research primarily focuses on theoretical exploration, future studies should include empirical validation and comparative analysis across different reader groups. Despite these limitations, this study aims to propose a new interpretation of Buddhist scriptures by examining them through an integrated perspective of literary expression and meditative practice, thereby suggesting the potential expansion of Applied Buddhism into the fields of mental health and spiritual education.",

      "abstract": "In Indian religious traditions, the attainment of death with full conscious awareness has long been idealized, reflecting the deep ontological connection posited between death and liberation (mok\u1e63a). Within this framework, Jainism\u2014grounded in a rigorous soul\u2013matter dualism\u2014developed highly systematized practices that aim to separate consciousness from both the body and karma not only at the moment of death but throughout daily practice, as exemplified by k\u0101yotsarga. Although sallekha\u1e47\u0101 (fasting unto death) has received considerable attention beyond Jain communities in the context of \u201cdeath with dignity,\u201d its deeper meditative dimensions have remained largely understudied. This article elucidates the meditative techniques of sam\u0101dhimara\u1e47a underlying sallekha\u1e47\u0101 by examining classical Jain sources on deathbed meditation, particularly the kevalin\u2019s procedures at the third and fourth stages of pure meditation (\u015bukladhy\u0101na). The analysis also addresses kevali-samudgh\u0101ta\u2014the uniquely Jain technique of \u201comniscient soul projection\u201d incorporated into the third stage of \u015bukladhy\u0101na in Hemacandra\u2019s twelfth-century Yoga\u015b\u0101stra\u2014thereby clarifying the broader meditative context of sallekha\u1e47\u0101. By situating sam\u0101dhimara\u1e47a within its doctrinal, meditative, and soteriological contexts\u2014rather than reducing it to suicide or to a religious variant of \u201cdeath with dignity\u201d\u2014this article contributes to a more precise and contextualized understanding of Jain deathbed meditation. In doing so, it also contributes to the expanding field of death-yoga studies that has so far focused primarily on Hindu and Buddhist traditions, highlighting the distinctive role of Jainism in the landscape of Indian contemplative practice.",

The main focus is on the analysis of the poet's poems (\u00abAh, our life,\u00bb \u00abBe patient, wait, mood (soul),\u00bb \u00abWhat should I do, oh, Almighty?,\u00bb \u00abI do not want to die without speaking out,\u00bb \u00abWords spoken before death,\u00bb etc.), revealing the central theme for his poetry \u00abfan\u00bb (the frailty of the world) through the prism of the Sufi worldview. It considers the split characteristic of the lyrical hero Emin between the momentary passions of the soul and the duty to God, his constant appeal to God, reliance on His mercy and the search for spiritual peace. The interweaving in his poetry of social, religious and philosophical motives (enlightenment, fatal predestination, the mortality of life, criticism of the depravity of the world), as well as the specifics of poetic forms (for example, muhammas) are analyzed. The article demonstrates how faith and the Sufi attitude to spiritual self-improvement determine Emin's artistic understanding of the world of fan, the suffering of man and his existential questions, while maintaining internal conflict and the dream of transforming the world.",

Utilizing a mixed-methods design, we combined quantitative assessments with qualitative insights to provide a comprehensive understanding of these relationships. A total of 347 intermediate EFL learners participated in the study, which included administering validated self-report scales and a modified IELTS proficiency test. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed to analyze the direct and indirect associations of mindfulness, self-regulation, and motivated behavior with L2 achievement. The quantitative results indicated that mindfulness and motivated behavior were significant predictors of L2 achievement, both directly and indirectly through self-regulation. Qualitative findings from in-depth interviews and focus groups further illuminated the mechanisms through which mindfulness and motivated behavior may support language learning, emphasizing the importance of self-regulation in this process. This study contributes to the literature by elucidating the interplay between these psychological factors and their relationship with L2 achievement, offering valuable insights for both educators and learners in the field of language pedagogy.",

Team interactions in such settings frequently reveal humor, irony, or cynicism, behaviors that represent underlying ego defense mechanisms. We explore how defense mechanisms such as humor and cynicism affect perioperative culture, teamwork, and leadership; and to argue that self-awareness, mindfulness, and relational maturity indirectly improve clinical outcomes. This conceptual analysis integrates psychoanalytic theories (Freud, Jung, Vaillant), developmental leadership frameworks, and empirical studies of coping, mindfulness, and culture from medicine, sport, and organizational psychology. Data from nursing and acute care suggest that psychological safety, emotional intelligence, and reflective practice correlate with performance and safety. Defensive patterns in professional behavior are not merely interpersonal; they shape patient care. Humor, sublimation and mindfulness reflect mature defenses that sustain connection and safety. Cynicism, an immature defense, isolates and fragments teams. A mindful, reflective culture in perioperative medicine is therefore an unmeasured determinant of clinical excellence.",

This study aimed to examine the temporal associations among social relationships, mindfulness, and physiological functioning and the potential mediating role of loneliness. METHODS: The present study recruited 141 older adults experiencing loneliness (M RESULTS: The participants showed small to moderate increases in perceived social support and mindfulness and small to moderate decreases in loneliness and pre-lunch cortisol. Greater improvements in social relationships were significantly associated with changes toward steeper diurnal cortisol slopes, indicating a healthier cortisol pattern. Greater improvements in mindfulness and social relationships were indirectly associated with greater reductions in CRP via a decrease in loneliness. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings provided empirical support for temporal associations between social relationships, mindfulness, and physiological markers, with loneliness acting as a mediator, in older adults. The results suggest that interventions targeting loneliness, while promoting social engagement and mindfulness, could improve both psychosocial and physiological well-being in this population.",

Therefore, the identification of risk factors associated with this phenomenon is essential for the development of preventative measures against social media fatigue. This study aimed to explore the relationship between fear of missing out and social media fatigue, the mediating role of information overload and perceived stress, and the moderating role of dispositional mindfulness. Adopting a longitudinal cluster sampling design, this study assessed college students using several psychometric instruments: Fear of missing out scale, information overload scale, Chinese perceived stress scale, social media fatigue scale, and mindfulness attention awareness scale. Data from 743 college students, collected and matched across three-time points, were analyzed to test the mediation and moderation effects. Findings from the study indicated that the independent and chain mediating effects of information overload and perceived stress were significant. Moreover, the negative moderating influences of dispositional mindfulness were also found to be significant. The results suggest that fear of missing out influences social media fatigue through two parallel pathways-information overload and perceived stress-and through a serial pathway involving both variables. Dispositional mindfulness can mitigate the impact of fear of missing out on information overload or perceived stress, as well as alleviate the mediating role of information overload and perceived stress. These findings provide valuable insights into social media fatigue and have significant implications for its prevention and intervention.",

This study aims to explore the relationship between insecure attachment style, psychological distress, and the mediating impact of mindfulness among patients with coronary heart disease. METHOD: This cross-sectional study was conducted using convenience sampling among 199 patients with coronary heart disease from medical centers in Aran-Bidgol and Kashan during 2022-2023. Data collection involved the use of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) for psychological distress assessment, the Collins and Reed attachment style questionnaire (RAAS) to gauge attachment style, and the Brown and Ryan mindfulness scale questionnaire (MAAS) to measure mindfulness. Data analysis was performed using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: The findings indicated a fit for the proposed model. Mindfulness was observed to mediate the relationship between avoidant attachment and psychological distress, while no mediating role was identified for anxious attachment and psychological distress. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the significance of attachment style in influencing both mindfulness and psychological distress levels among patients with coronary heart disease. Moreover, enhancing mindfulness emerges as an avenue for mitigating the impact of insecure attachment styles and subsequently reducing psychological distress in this patient population.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is an evidence-based program that integrates meditation, bodily awareness, and yoga to manage stress and reduce anxiety. Neuroimaging studies suggest that MBSR modulates brain networks involved in emotion regulation, self-awareness, and attention, though findings remain inconsistent. Structural and functional MRI (fMRI) have been used to investigate these effects, focusing on default mode, salience, limbic, and central executive networks. OBJECTIVE: To synthesize MRI and fMRI research on the effects of MBSR on brain structure, neural activation, and functional connectivity, with emphasis on networks related to emotion and attention regulation. MATERIALS & METHODS: A narrative review was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and Scopus to identify studies published between 2009-2024 on MBSR and neuroimaging. Search terms included yoga, mindfulness-based stress reduction, MRI, fMRI, and neuroimaging. Of 586 articles screened, 27 met inclusion criteria, comprising 9 structural MRI, 10 neural activation, and 11 functional connectivity studies. RESULTS: Structural MRI findings were inconsistent; most studies reported no significant gray matter changes. Small studies noted modest increases in hippocampal and amygdala volume. In contrast, fMRI consistently demonstrated functional changes across key networks. Neural activation studies showed increased activity in the superior parietal lobule, posterior cingulate cortex, and prefrontal regions. Functional connectivity studies reported enhanced coupling between the medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala. CONCLUSION: MBSR appears to influence brain function more than structure, with consistent enhancement of activity and connectivity in networks that support emotion regulation, self-referential processing, and attention. Findings suggest improved top-down regulation of emotion, though study heterogeneity limits conclusions.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders significantly impact the quality of life in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS), affecting up to 60% of this population. These disorders, including insomnia, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, narcolepsy, and REM sleep behaviour disorders, result from both the direct neurological impacts of MS and secondary factors, such as pain and medication side effects. Non-pharmacological interventions offer potential benefits without the adverse effects associated with medications. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions in improving sleep disorders in pwMS, address inconsistencies in individual studies, and provide estimates of the magnitude of improvement. The review followed PRISMA guidelines and included randomised controlled trials, even if pilot studies, that examined non-pharmacological interventions for sleep disorders in pwMS. The literature search was completed in April 2024 in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases. Data were extracted on study design, participant characteristics, intervention details, and outcomes. Quality was assessed using the PEDro scale, and a random-effects meta-analysis was conducted. The primary outcome was the assessment of sleep quality. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria, encompassing various non-pharmacological interventions such as cognitive-behavioural therapy, mindfulness, aerobic exercise, and occupational therapy. Non-pharmacological interventions may effectively improve sleep disorders in pwMS, while also providing additional benefits for overall psychological well-being and quality of life. Future research should focus on long-term effects, underlying mechanisms, and standardising intervention protocols to enhance comparability and generalisability. The major limitation of the meta-analysis is the high heterogeneity among eligible studies.",

      "abstract": "Psychological interventions based on mindfulness and cognition have shown promise for treating ADHD, yet their application in children remains understudied. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness and sustainability of mindfulness and cognitive strategy interventions in reducing core symptoms of ADHD in children. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted involving 70 children with ADHD aged 6-12, who were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a mindfulness-based cognitive intervention group (M\u00a0+\u00a0CB, n\u00a0=\u00a022), a cognitive-based mindfulness intervention group (C\u00a0+\u00a0MB, n\u00a0=\u00a023), both of which consisted of a 12-week intervention involving mindfulness and cognitive-behavioral strategy training, or a control group (n\u00a0=\u00a025) that followed care-as-usual without psychological intervention. Both M\u00a0+\u00a0CB and C\u00a0+\u00a0MB groups showed significant reductions in parent-rated ADHD symptoms [M\u00a0+\u00a0CB: d\u00a0=\u00a00.68, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01; C\u00a0+\u00a0MB: d\u00a0=\u00a00.55, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01] at post-treatment compared to the control group. These effects were consistently maintained at 1- and 4-months follow-ups. A higher proportion of children showed reliable post-treatment improvements in the intervention groups versus the control group (63.6\u00a0% vs. 52.2\u00a0% vs. 8.0\u00a0%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), with those having more severe baseline symptoms benefiting more from the intervention. Significant improvements were also observed in child-measured inhibitory control, with these changes predicting the degree of improvement in core symptoms. Additionally, the M\u00a0+\u00a0CB group exhibited greater reductions in parent-rated hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms and executive function deficits, as well as enhanced performance in child-measured executive function. This study provides evidence supporting the effectiveness of interventions combining mindfulness and cognitive-behavioral strategies for children with ADHD, which may be valuable treatment options for reducing symptoms and enhancing executive functions.",

Utilizing a quota-representative sample of 931 Israeli Jews, we assessed individual and community PTG following the Hamas attack of 7 October 2023, alongside a range of factors guided by Bronfenbrenner's Process-Person-Context-Time (PPCT) model. Using data-driven techniques, we identified three distinct growth profiles: relatively high individual and collective PTG (n\u2009=\u2009354), high PTG on all dimensions (n\u2009=\u2009273), and secular growth showing high PTG in general but not in spiritual terms (n\u2009=\u2009322). Higher levels of religious identification, involvement, and coping, altruistic behaviour, social support, optimism, and mindfulness, as well as lower levels of pessimism, were found in the group(s) with the highest PTG. This research highlights the potentially high societal resilience reported after a large-scale traumatic event, identifying factors that may be tested for their potential to maximize growth in the aftermath of trauma.",

Such complexity may obscure the neural mechanisms that give rise to conscious experience. Here, we propose that advanced meditation-referring to states and stages of practice that unfold progressively with increasing expertise-offers a powerful yet unexplored opportunity to isolate the core features of consciousness through a theory-driven neuroscience approach. We focus on two classes of meditative phenomena: advanced concentrative absorption (related to what have been called jh\u0101na), which involves the preservation of highly abstract forms of awareness alongside the attenuation of typical features of consciousness; and meditative endpoints-namely, cessation events (related to what have been called nirodha)-which involve the temporary suspension of consciousness altogether. These phenomena serve as precise, replicable, and experimentally tractable phenomenological anchors for a minimal model framework, a novel approach aimed at identifying and characterizing the simplest possible form of conscious experience as a principled starting point for a systematic science of consciousness. Within this framework, the integration of advanced meditation into experimental paradigms offers a promising path toward identifying the neural mechanisms that support consciousness in its most reduced and fundamental forms.",

However, the comparative effectiveness of these interventions remains uncertain. METHODS: We included randomized controlled trials of non-pharmacological interventions for cancer-related cognitive impairment identified through searches of PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and SinoMed through February 2025. Extracted data comprised study details, participant characteristics, intervention types, and outcomes. Treatment effects were quantified as standardized mean difference with 95\u00a0% confidence interval and pooled using random-effects models. We analyzed both subjective and objective cognitive outcomes, including attention, executive function, memory, processing speed, and language. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD 42023457681). RESULTS: A total of 60 eligible studies involving 5129 patients were identified. Based on intervention characteristics, these studies were categorized into six categories: cognitive behavioral therapy-based interventions, cognitive training, physical activity, mindfulness-based interventions, multi-modal management, and acupuncture. Significant improvements in subjective cognition were associated with cognitive behavioral therapy-based interventions (7 comparisons, standardized mean difference: 0.53, 95\u00a0% confidence interval: 0.22 to 0.84, I CONCLUSIONS: Current randomized evidence indicates that several non-pharmacological interventions can improve subjective and/or objective cognition in adults with cancer-related cognitive impairment. However, substantial between-study heterogeneity and generally low certainty of evidence limit confidence in these estimates. Clinicians should tailor intervention selection to individual patient needs and the clinical context. Moreover, further, better-powered, well-reported and standardized trials are needed.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A negative relationship between mindful eating and eating disorder risk has been suggested in previous research. However, the potential mediating roles of depression and body mass index (BMI) in the relationship between the four facets of mindful eating and eating disorders remain understudied. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the associations between the four facets of mindful eating and the risk of eating disorders in adults, and to explore possible mediators of this relationship. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted online with 239 participants. Data were collected using the Four Facet Mindful Eating Scale (FFaMES), the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire-13 (EDE-Q-13), and the Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). To identify potential mediating factors, multiple mediation analyses were performed to examine the relationship between mindful eating and eating disorder risk. RESULTS: Higher levels of mindful eating were inversely correlated with eating disorder risk (r\u2009=\u2009-0.569, p\u2009<\u20090.001), depression (r\u2009=\u2009-0.321, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and BMI (r\u2009=\u2009-0.314, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Conversely, eating disorder risk was positively correlated with both depression (r\u2009=\u20090.268, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and BMI (r\u2009=\u20090.341, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Mediation analyses revealed that depression (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.012, 95% CI [-0.025, -0.002]) and BMI (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.018, 95% CI [-0.033, -0.007]) were potential mediators of the association between non-reactance and eating disorder risk. A similar pattern was observed for non-judgment, with depression (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.016, 95% CI [-0.032, -0.004]) and BMI (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.021, 95% CI [-0.041, -0.007]) identified as potential mediators. Eating with internal awareness was associated with higher eating disorder risk, with depression partially mediating this relationship (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.030, 95% CI [0.008, 0.060]), whereas no mediation effect was found for eating with external awareness (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.021, 95% CI [-0.016, 0.051]). Overall, higher depression (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.012, 95% CI [-0.025, -0.002]) and higher BMI (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.018, 95% CI [-0.064, -0.032]) were identified as potential mediators in the association between lower mindful eating and higher eating disorder risk. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that mindful eating in adults is associated with lower eating disorder risk, and that BMI and depression scores are potential mediators of this relationship.",

This study was designed prospective, two-armed (1:1), randomized clinical trial with assessments on primary and secondary outcomes at baseline, post-intervention, at the 1-month follow-up, and 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome of the study was the change in care burden. Secondary outcomes included changes in anxiety, hopelessness, and self-compassion levels. The study sample consisted of 50 family caregivers (intervention group\u2009=\u200925, control group\u2009=\u200925). In the intervention group, there was a statistically significantly decrease in state anxiety, trait anxiety, hopelessness and caregiver burden, as well as a significant increase in self-compassion compared to the control group at post-intervention, at the 1-month follow-up and 3-month follow-up. These results show promise that MBSR may be an effective intervention for family caregivers of individuals with psychosis.

      "abstract": "In the past few decades, online games have become immensely popular among the younger generation thus leading to online game addiction. Previous researches acknowledge that mindfulness or present-focused awareness may reduce addiction. Moreover, addiction is found to have an impact on the propensity to respond to the situations in the environment in a way that is acceptable to all the people (emotional control). The present study attempts to study the influence of mindfulness and emotional control on game addiction. For this, 187 college students were selected through the Simple Random Sampling method. Personal Profile Sheet, The Online Game Addiction Scale, Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) and The Emotional Control Questionnaire, with four dimensions of Rehearsal, Emotional Inhibition, Aggression Control and Benign control were used to collect the data. The study found a significant gender difference in the level of game addiction where boys being more addicted to online games than girls. Mindfulness shows a significant negative influence over Game Addiction. Among the four dimensions of emotional control, the two dimensions viz., rehearsal and benign control show mediation effect between mindfulness and game addiction. However, the mediating role of emotional inhibition and aggression control was not significantly demonstrative.",

      "abstract": "Prior studies suggest that mindfulness interventions are viable for alleviating insomnia; however, the potential bidirectional link between mindfulness and insomnia warrants a longitudinal study. This study investigates the bidirectional link between mindfulness and insomnia and the mediating role of negative affect. We tracked and surveyed 254 students from a university in East China on mindfulness, negative affect, and insomnia over 2\u2009months and collected their reports at baseline (Time 1), 1\u2009month later (Time 2), and 2\u2009months later (Time 3). Random intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs) were employed to examine the bidirectional links among these variables. The results revealed mixed support for reciprocal links between mindfulness and insomnia, showing bidirectional links only between Time 2 and Time 3 but not between Time 1 and Time 2. Negative affect mediated the negative link between mindfulness and insomnia. Although elevated negative affect predicted decreased mindfulness, insomnia did not predict negative affect longitudinally, and negative affect did not mediate the longitudinal link from insomnia to mindfulness. Accordingly, our findings suggest that mindfulness-based interventions for insomnia may benefit from prioritizing components that target negative affect, which may trigger an upward spiral that improves sleep and sustains mindfulness.",

METHOD: Using daily dairy procedures, 536 early adolescents (M RESULTS: Daily increases in social mindfulness were linked to concurrent and next-day reductions in reactive but not proactive aggressive behavior. Daily increases in social mindfulness were associated with reductions in the next day's reactive aggressive behavior, particularly among those who perceived the classroom interpersonal climate as average or below average.

The new triple correlation will be explored through the following lens: not only do love and happiness reinforce moral action, but they appear to be in a triple circularly supportive relationship. Moral behavior is frequently grounded in love; love encourages prosocial behavior; prosocial behavior increases happiness; happiness, in turn, enhances the inclination of most people to act morally most of the time. Argued from the opposite direction: happiness tends to encourage prosocial behavior in most people most of the time; prosocial behavior is conducive to the development of loving relationships; love induces us to behave morally toward the people we love. The argument presented here will also propose that this triple circular reinforcement can be significantly deepened and sustained through a careful use of love-enhancing substances, aided by guided meditation-particularly in the case of the psychedelic psilocybin. It will be concluded that humans will be motivated to use love drugs because they tend to increase their happiness. Consequently, a voluntary use of love drugs is a more effective means of moral (bio-)enhancement than is the prevention of \"ultimate harm\" that is based on compulsory moral enhancement.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs), which integrate ethical and moral practices, have emerged as promising treatments for depressive and anxiety symptoms. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effectiveness of SG-MBIs in reducing depression and anxiety among adults. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including adults from clinical populations, healthy adults, and mixed groups (e.g., individuals reporting psychological distress or physical health conditions without formal diagnoses). Databases searched included PubMed, Web of Science, and EBSCOhost (through April 2025). Effect sizes were computed using Hedges' g, calculated as the standardized mean differences between intervention and control groups at post-intervention, adjusted for small-sample bias, and synthesized under a random-effects model. Primary analyses focused on post-intervention outcomes, and additional analyses assessed long-term effects based on follow-up data from 20 trials (17 depression, 13 anxiety). In total, 43 studies on depression (n\u00a0=\u00a03756) and 37 studies on anxiety (n\u00a0=\u00a03199) were included. Moderator analyses tested participant type, control condition, intervention components, intervention type, primary outcome status and risk of bias status. RESULTS: SG-MBIs significantly reduced depressive (g\u00a0=\u00a00.59, 95\u00a0% CI [0.41, 0.78]) and anxiety symptoms (g\u00a0=\u00a00.61, 95\u00a0% CI [0.41, 0.81]); effects remained significant after outlier removal (depression: g\u00a0=\u00a00.44; anxiety: g\u00a0=\u00a00.40). Participant type significantly moderated outcomes, with clinical samples showing significantly larger improvements than both healthy and mixed samples. Intervention type also significantly moderated results. Control conditions, intervention components, outcome measures, primary outcome status, risk of bias status, and intervention duration were not significant moderators. Follow-up data (k\u00a0=\u00a020) indicated sustained depression reductions (g\u00a0=\u00a00.70). Most included trials were rated as having \"some concerns\" (n\u00a0=\u00a033), with 13 judged as low risk and 3 as high risk, suggesting that overall findings should be interpreted with caution. However, sensitivity analyses excluding these high-risk studies yielded similar results (depression: g\u00a0=\u00a00.61; anxiety: g\u00a0=\u00a00.64). CONCLUSIONS: SG-MBIs effectively reduce depression and anxiety and may be particularly valuable for clinical populations and self-compassion-focused interventions. Future research should aim for clearer operational definitions, standardized intervention protocols, exploration of wisdom-based components, and adequately powered RCTs to strengthen the evidence base and enhance clinical applicability.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alexithymia often co-occurs with emotional symptoms such as anxiety, stress, and depression, as well as cognitive characteristics including boredom proneness, intolerance of uncertainty, and fear of negative evaluation, contributing to difficulties in academic, emotional, and interpersonal functioning. However, traditional analytical methods often neglect the dynamic and interactive nature of these symptoms, and few intervention studies have specifically targeted the interconnected structure of this comorbidity. Our study applied a symptom network perspective to explore potential underlying mechanisms and guide a focused intervention approach. METHODS: Study 1 employed network analysis (NA) to identify bridge symptoms linking alexithymia to its comorbid features among 1024 Chinese college students. Study 2 evaluated a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) specifically designed to target those bridge symptoms. 70 participants with alexithymia randomly selected from study1 and assigned to either an MBI or a control group. The MBI group received the intervention once a week for 8\u00a0weeks, whereas the control group received no treatment. Outcome measures were collected at pre-intervention, post-intervention and at 1-month follow-up. RESULTS: Study 1 suggested that anxiety and stress serve as bridge symptoms. In study 2, participants in the MBI group showed greater improvements than the control group across alexithymia, anxiety, stress, depression, boredom proneness, and intolerance of uncertainty. Most changes were maintained at 1-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide preliminary support for the value of combining NA with targeted intervention design. By addressing bridge symptoms, such interventions may offer a more integrated approach to reducing alexithymia and its related symptoms among college students.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Frontline nurses face heavy infection control demands, rotating shifts, and psychological stress, leading to pandemic fatigue and reduced resilience. Evidence on mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for this group remains limited. AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness of an online MBSR program on pandemic-related fatigue and resilience among nurses in COVID-19-designated wards. METHOD: A convergent parallel mixed-methods design was used. Sixty nurses were assigned to the MBSR (n\u00a0=\u00a030) or control (n\u00a0=\u00a030) groups. The six-week online program included weekly 90-min sessions. Data were collected at baseline (T1), week 3 (T2), and week 6 (T3). Seven MBSR participants also completed qualitative interviews. RESULTS: At baseline, both groups demonstrated moderate levels of pandemic fatigue and resilience. The MBSR group showed a significant reduction in pandemic fatigue at T3 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) but not at T2 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.057), and significant improvements in resilience at both T2 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and T3 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Compared with the control group, the MBSR group exhibited significantly greater reductions in fatigue at T2 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007) and T3 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), as well as greater improvements in resilience at T2 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and T3 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Qualitative analysis further identified four themes illustrating participants' experiences of the program. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that an online MBSR program may help alleviate pandemic fatigue and strengthen resilience among frontline nurses. Integrating digital mindfulness programs into occupational health initiatives could support nurses' mental well-being and compassionate care in high-stress clinical settings.

      "abstract": "Despite the growing popularity of mindfulness, mindfulness-based programs (MBPs), and meditation, potential harms have largely been overlooked. Recent studies reveal that 25-87 % of those who engage in meditation report adverse effects (AEs), with 3-37 % experiencing functional impairment (e.g., inability to work). It remains unclear to what extent AEs reflect transitory discomfort vs. lasting harm. Common AEs include anxiety, depression, and traumatic re-experiencing. Factors such as retreat attendance and pre-existing mental health conditions may increase the risk of AEs, though causality remains unclear. The review emphasises the need for thorough screening, informed consent, and ongoing monitoring in clinical practice. Recommendations include setting clear expectations, offering psychoeducational support, and adapting interventions when necessary and where appropriate. By addressing these concerns, clinicians can better balance the potential benefits with the potential risks, ensuring more responsible implementation of mindfulness and meditation in mental health care and beyond.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Awake bruxism (AB) is characterised by repetitive or sustained masticatory muscle activity during wakefulness, including clenching, grinding, or mandibular bracing. Recent consensus defines AB as a motor behaviour influenced by psychological and contextual factors. Among these, dispositional mindfulness may play a modulatory role in the frequency and intensity of AB episodes. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate how standardised cognitive tasks of varying complexity modulate awake bruxism (AB) and to investigate whether dispositional mindfulness is associated with the frequency, duration, and amplitude of AB episodes measured by surface electromyography. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 68 dental students (18-40\u2009years) from the School of Dentistry of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, University of S\u00e3o Paulo. Participants were classified into AB and control groups based on self-report and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). Surface electromyography (sEMG) of the masseter muscle was recorded during five conditions: rest, maximal voluntary clenching, self-report questionnaires, mathematical tasks of different complexity, and an electronic memory game (Genius). Episodes were analysed at thresholds of 10%, 20%, and 30% of maximal voluntary contraction (Ap10, Ap20, Ap30), extracting frequency, duration, and amplitude. Dispositional mindfulness was assessed using the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). Statistical analyses included Friedman tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE), and Spearman correlations. RESULTS: Controls showed increased episode frequency at lower thresholds (Ap10) as task complexity rose, whereas AB individuals maintained elevated frequencies across all tasks. Significant between-group differences were observed at higher thresholds (Ap20, Ap30). Duration and amplitude showed no significant differences, except for a trend of greater amplitude in controls during the Genius task. Within the AB group, higher dispositional mindfulness was associated with fewer and shorter contraction episodes, a pattern consistent with previous research indicating a potential protective association. (notably at Ap30) and shorter durations across tasks, while no associations were observed in controls. CONCLUSION: AB individuals exhibited a stable and persistent pattern of masticatory muscle activity, contrasting with the adaptive modulation observed in controls. Higher dispositional mindfulness was linked to fewer and shorter contraction episodes in the AB group, suggesting a protective role. These findings highlight the relevance of integrating psychological traits, such as mindfulness, into the behavioural understanding and management of AB.",

      "abstract": "Postpartum depression (PPD) impacts the health of both mothers and their offspring, underscoring the importance of early identification of risk factors for PPD. While both low-trait mindfulness and blunted neural processing to emotional stimuli (indexed by the late positive potential; LPP) have been separately associated with depression, previous work has highlighted an inverse relationship between trait mindfulness and neural emotional processing. Thus, it remains unclear how facets of trait mindfulness and neural emotional processing interact as risk factors for PPD. During the second trimester, pregnant women (n = 117) completed the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS), and an infant face matching task while continuous electroencephalography was recorded. At 9 weeks postpartum, participants' PPD symptoms were reassessed with the IDAS. A series of hierarchical linear regression models revealed that acting with awareness, a trait mindfulness facet, and LPP to happy infant faces interacted to predict PPD symptoms (\u03b2 = .217, p = .014, 95% CI [.045, .390]) after adjusting for depression levels in mid-pregnancy, such that low acting with awareness was associated with greater PPD symptoms when LPP to happy infant faces was 1 standard deviation below (\u03b2 = -.548, SE = .150 , p < .001) and at the mean (\u03b2 = -.309, SE = .106, p = .004). Findings suggest that an enhanced LPP to positively valenced stimuli may be protective against postpartum depression for those with low-trait mindfulness.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fear of childbirth is common among pregnant women. Mindfulness-based interventions have been used widely in obstetrics. However, the evidence of the effects on fear of childbirth is controversial. AIMS: To evaluate the effects of mindfulness-based interventions on fear of childbirth, pain catastrophising, labour pain intensity, use of pain relief medication, mode of delivery and duration of labour among pregnant women planned for normal delivery. METHODS: In this systematic review, 10 databases were searched from inception to 7 November 2024. Randomized controlled trials implementing mindfulness-based interventions for fear of childbirth or related outcomes were included. Two reviewers assessed the methodological quality and certainty of evidence independently. Standardized mean difference (SMD), risk ratio (RR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to evaluate effect sizes. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies from 15 trials were included. Based on very low to moderate certainty of evidence, mindfulness-based interventions were effective in decreasing fear of childbirth both immediately post-intervention and within 6-week postpartum (SMD: -0.72; 95% CI -0.89, -0.55; SMD: -0.63; 95% CI -0.91, -0.35, respectively), labour pain intensity (SMD: -1.22; 95% CI -2.07, -0.37), caesarean section rate (RR: 0.58; 95% CI 0.36, 0.93), and total duration of labour (SMD: -1.03; 95% CI -1.34, -0.72), and improving mindfulness level both immediately post-intervention and within six-week postpartum (SMD: 0.48; 95% CI 0.31, 0.66; SMD: 0.50; 95% CI 0.27, 0.73, respectively), but had no significant effect on pain catastrophising (SMD: -0.36; 95% CI -0.72, 0.01) and epidural analgesia use rate (RR: 0.77; 95% CI 0.57, 1.03). LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Mindfulness-based interventions have potential effects on reducing fear of childbirth and promoting labour-related outcomes. These interventions might be an effective approach in obstetrics clinical practice to enhance the pregnancy and labour experiences among pregnant women.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sleep quality declines in the immediate postoperative period following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). No prior study has prospectively analyzed the impact of mindfulness meditation (MM) on sleep quality following TKA. The purpose of this study was to determine whether MM administered in conjunction with TKA results in any improvement in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at 2, 6, or 12 weeks postoperatively. METHODS: Patients undergoing primary unilateral TKA were prospectively enrolled and randomized into 3 cohorts. The perioperative MM cohort received MM at the preoperative visit, the day preceding surgery, 3 days postoperatively, and 2 weeks postoperatively. The preoperative MM group only received MM at the preoperative visit. Controls received no MM. MM consisted of a video of 2 licensed professional psychologists guiding viewers through a 15-minute MM. Demographic data were collected and questionnaires completed at 2, 6, and 12 weeks postoperatively. Patients were excluded on the basis of prior alcohol/drug dependence and inability to present to in-person visits. An a priori analysis required 75 patients per cohort to achieve 80% power. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-two patients were enrolled and randomized to 3 groups: control (n = 94), preoperative MM (n = 94), and perioperative MM (n = 94). There were no differences between cohorts in age ( CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness training did not improve postoperative sleep quality at any time point following TKA. Further studies are warranted, as improving sleep quality may enhance TKA rehabilitation. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level II.",

      "abstract": "CLINICAL SCENARIO: Although chronic ankle instability (CAI) and ankle sprains are highly prevalent, there has been little advancement in treatment strategies. A challenging aspect of CAI rehabilitation is the multifaceted nature of CAI. Sensorimotor deficits particularly dynamic postural control impairments, are well documented in those with CAI relative to uninjured controls and likely contribute to the high prevalence of CAI. Because CAI is associated with deficits in sensory pathways, mind-body interventions may help enhance a patient's awareness and processing of sensory information (ie,\u00a0proprioception). Improved proprioception may subsequently result in more confidence in bodily movements, which we hypothesize would manifest as improved dynamic postural control. FOCUSED CLINICAL QUESTION: Do mind-body interventions, relative to a control condition, improve dynamic postural control in patients with CAI? SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS: Two studies found that a 12-week Yang style Tai Chi resulted in significantly greater improvements in all Star Excursion Balance Test reach directions compared with the respective control groups. One study found that a 4-week walking meditation program (which entails the participant slowly walking back and forth while keeping their concentration on movements of the body) resulted in significant improvements on some Star Excursion Balance Test reach directions, but these changes were not different from the changes observed in the control group. CLINICAL BOTTOM LINE: The results indicate that mind-body interventions, especially Tai Chi, can improve dynamic postural control in those with CAI.\u00a0Strength of Recommendation: Overall consistent high-quality evidence was present in the 3 studies, suggesting grade A evidence for the use of mind-body interventions in the rehabilitation of patients with CAI.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: U.S. military veterans frequently experience exposure to trauma and multiple co-occurring physical health and psychiatric conditions that can impair functioning. Nonetheless, some veterans maintain higher-than-expected levels of functioning despite these adversities, a pattern reflecting functional resilience. Identifying modifiable factors associated with such resilience may inform interventions to support optimal functioning in this population. METHODS: Data were analyzed from 4069 participants in the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, a nationally representative survey of U.S. veterans. Four domains of functioning-physical, mental, cognitive, and psychosocial-were combined via exploratory factor analysis to derive a composite functioning score. Functional resilience was operationalized using a discrepancy-based residual approach, in which the composite functioning score was regressed onto measures of trauma exposure and physical and mental health burden. Positive residuals represented better-than-expected functioning given trauma- and health-related burden. Bivariate, multivariable, and relative importance analyses were conducted to identify sociodemographic, psychosocial, and personality correlates of functional resilience. RESULTS: A single latent factor accounted for 60.5\u00a0% of the variance across functioning domains. Mindfulness, grit, and perceived resilience were the strongest correlates of functional resilience, jointly explaining over 75\u00a0% of the total explained variance. Additional independent correlates included conscientiousness, physical exercise, positive expectations about aging, and community integration. Older age and being married or partnered were also associated with higher functional resilience. CONCLUSIONS: Modifiable psychosocial traits and health behaviors are strongly associated with functional resilience among U.S. veterans. Interventions that enhance mindfulness, grit, perceived resilience, and positive attitudes toward aging may help promote better functional outcomes in this population.",

      "abstract": "This narrative review examined the current landscape and evidence base of smartphone applications (apps) designed to support perinatal mental health. Using systematic search methods, we identified apps from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store between April 29 and May 11, 2025, using terms such as \"maternal mental health,\" \"perinatal mental health,\" \"postpartum health,\" and \"pregnant mental health.\" We included apps if they were marketed to perinatal individuals in the United States and aimed to improve mental health outcomes. For each app, we extracted key features (eg, mood tracking, psychoeducation, mindfulness exercises) and cross-referenced PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify any published or ongoing studies evaluating efficacy, classifying evidence using the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force grading system. Of 587 apps identified, 38 met inclusion criteria, but only three (8%) had peer-reviewed evidence: one with moderate-quality data (Grade B) and two with insufficient evidence (Grade I). Six apps (16%) had ongoing randomized controlled trials to determine efficacy. Collectively, these findings reveal that despite the rapid expansion of perinatal mental health apps, very few have undergone rigorous evaluation. This lack of evidence raises concerns about efficacy, safety, accountability, and value-based care. To ensure safe and effective mental health care delivery, efforts must prioritize the development of evidence-based digital perinatal mental health interventions and apply greater caution in marketing unproven tools directly to patients.",

      "abstract": "Classical psychedelics, like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and psilocybin, can alter perception, emotion, and cognition, and have shown promise as 're-purposed' treatments for some psychiatric disorders. Recent trials have, e.g., demonstrated rapid and sustained symptom relief in treatment-resistant depression. While promising as a treatment, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying both the subjective and clinical effects remain incompletely understood. Also, their broader influence on (intra) cellular processes, neural circuits, and brain-wide connectivity is less well documented. Here, we review the molecular and network-level alterations induced by classical serotonergic psychedelics through a systematic review of experimental and (pre)clinical studies from 1990 onward. We focus on the short-term impact on receptor activity, intracellular signaling, and functional brain connectivity underlying the psychedelic experience. Most psychedelics primarily act as serotonin 5\u2011HT\u2082A receptor agonists, initiating intracellular signaling pathways that modulate neuroplasticity, glutamate release, and cortical excitability. Psychedelics disrupt functional network connectivity, particularly within the default mode network, while enhancing global integration across brain regions. These effects are associated with subjective experiences of 'ego dissolution' and altered perception, which may contribute to their therapeutic effects. This review synthesizes findings at the molecular and systems level and their interaction during the psychedelic state. While no single model explains all effects, several overlapping theories begin to bridge receptor-level activity with large-scale brain connectivity changes. Improving our understanding of their neurobiological basis may help clarify how psychedelics act and allows for more tailored opportunities to enhance their therapeutic effects and clinical application in a stratified manner.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clinicians' ability to develop an alliance with and to regulate their emotional responses to suicidal patients may have significant impact on those patients' suicidal outcomes. To date, the field has yet to develop empirically supported trainings to enhance clinicians' alliance and self-regulation with high-risk patients. This study's goal was to assess the effectiveness of such a training using cutting-edge virtual human interactions technology to enhance the therapeutic alliance and reduce outpatients' suicidal outcomes. METHODS: Outpatient clinicians with active caseloads were randomly assigned to two study conditions (virtual suicidal human interaction with and without emotional self-awareness training). An extraneous control group was composed of outpatient clinicians who did not engage in virtual human interactions. The impact of the training on clinicians' alliance with their actual patients and those patients' suicidal outcomes was assessed with repeated-measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Emotional self-awareness training led to greater improvements in both patient ratings of the bond component of the alliance and therapist-rated agreement on the therapeutic task component of the alliance. Emotional self-awareness training was also associated with greater reduction in panic/dissociation-related suicide crisis symptoms compared to the no-training condition. Across the conditions, suicidal outcomes improved significantly. Suicidal ideation and behaviors decreased more in both interaction conditions compared to the non-interaction controls. DISCUSSION: The study provides preliminary indication that virtual human interaction training may be effective in improving the therapeutic alliance and reducing suicidal outcomes in psychiatric outpatients. Hence, scalable virtual human technology may hold promises in the field of suicide prevention.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Violence in caregiving settings is a\u00a0complex and increasingly prevalent issue, rooted in both structural and individual factors. To date, systematic analyses of police responses to such cases have been largely absent. OBJECTIVE: This study explores which risk factors and offense patterns are associated with abuse in care as well as the challenges faced by law enforcement agencies. The aim is to identify actionable strategies for improving the handling of violence in caregiving contexts. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The research is based on an analysis of 106 documented cases and 64\u00a0expert interviews across multiple disciplines. The findings were further discussed in interdisciplinary workshops to develop practical solutions for enhancing protection of care-dependent individuals. Various limitations reduce the significance and generalizability of the findings. RESULTS: Most victims were female (69%) with an average age of 80\u00a0years and equally represented in home and institutional care. In 73% of cases the perpetrators were professional caregivers. The offenses primarily involved physical violence and unlawful deprivation of liberty. The case dismissal rate was 89%, often due to limited testimonial capacity and insufficient legal documentation. Police procedures were optimized and the interdisciplinary network violence-free care was established. CONCLUSION: Key insights of the network emphasize the need for cross-sectoral collaboration, ongoing awareness training and professional development. The network advocates clear reporting pathways, targeted protective services and structured case management for vulnerable care recipients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite yoga's known benefits for physical and mental health, studies face challenges like small samples and high attrition, especially with medical professionals showing low adherence to yoga practices. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess yoga practice adherence, mainly participant experiences, future preferences, and its impact on participants' emotional states over a 6-week period. METHODS: the comprehensive yoga adherence program, including a 30-minute instructional video and weekly motivational messages and reminders. The video, accessible on various devices, was divided into pre-yoga stretches, yogic asanas, breathing exercises, and guided meditation. The study involved 15 participants from diverse backgrounds, including medical students, staff, and faculty members (above 18 years of age). Data collection was through three surveys, focusing on daily adherence, practice frequency, reasons for missed sessions, emotional states post-practice, and future yoga practice preferences. The study was conducted during the 2023/2024 academic year on the California University of Science and Medicine (CUSM) campus. RESULTS: On average, participants engaged in yoga practice four days per week, with 17% practicing daily.: 20% of participants discontinued the practice during the study. 80% of participants reported feeling relaxed and happy after sessions, and none felt tired or bored. Common barriers to adherence included lack of time, motivation, and preference for alternative workouts. Participants expressed a strong desire to continue practicing yoga in the future, with varied preferences for virtual or in-person practice formats. CONCLUSION: The study offers insights into the implementation challenges and feasibility of a comprehensive yoga adherence program. It highlights factors influencing participants' adherence and future practice preferences, contributing to effective strategies for promoting regular yoga practice and integrating it into wellness routines. The findings emphasize the need for tailored support to address diverse barriers to adherence and preferences for yoga formats. While there was significant adherence, understanding these factors is crucial for tailoring future programs to enhance participation and adherence.",

METHODS: For this integrative review, we searched CINAHL, MEDLINE, PubMed, APA PsycINFO, Web of Science, and manual search between January 2013 and August 2024. Search terms included combinations of HF, self-care, and spirituality-related keywords. Hawker and colleagues' critical appraisal tool was utilized to analyze the quality of this review. RESULTS: We analyzed 15 studies and derived 3 themes: Heterogeneous and interconnected, spirituality as a predictor of self-care, and social and cultural consideration. Most define spirituality as seeking meaning and connection to a transcendent being, and the FACIT-Sp scale was the most commonly used. In 20% of studies, the influence of spirituality was examined using self-care measurements in people with HF. The facilitating factors to integrating spirituality into care included social support, resilience, gratitude, approach coping, prayer, meditation, and religious affiliation, while the barriers included disease severity, burden, and cultural differences. CONCLUSIONS: Spirituality serves as an inner resource that enhances HF self-care by providing personal meaning and self-transcendence, extending beyond traditional religious practices. Healthcare providers should assess the spiritual needs of individuals with HF and provide individualized self-care support that considers the social and cultural backgrounds that can enhance spirituality.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between tinnitus severity and validated measures of life stress. BACKGROUND: An estimated 740 million people worldwide experience tinnitus, with approximately 17% reporting severe symptoms associated with reduced quality of life. In 1985, Gerber et al. failed to identify a correlation between tinnitus severity and life stress and suggested limited value in psychotherapy-based interventions. However, current guidelines widely recommend stress-reduction strategies such as cognitive behavioral therapy and meditation for tinnitus management. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis of patients undergoing tinnitus evaluation at a Tertiary Academic Center between 2011-2022 was performed. Statistical analyses included T-test, linear regression, and ordinary least squares regression. RESULTS: A total of 785 patients (mean age 53.9 \u00b1 15.4 years; 52.6% male) were included. Constant tinnitus was reported by 76% of patients, though tinnitus constancy showed no correlation with Holmes-Rahe (HR) stress scores or THI/TRQ scores. Ringing was the most commonly reported tinnitus percept (52%), followed by other (39%), buzzing (25%), tonal (11%), humming (10%), and static (9%), with no percept type correlating with stress or severity scores. OLS regression demonstrated a significant positive correlation between tinnitus awareness, THI, and TRQ scores and HR risk scores, a subcategory predicting stress-related illness. Normal high-frequency bilateral DPOAEs were associated with higher THI/TRQ scores compared to absent, abnormal, or uncertain responses (p < 0.05). No associations were observed with low- or mid-frequency DPOAEs. CONCLUSIONS: Tinnitus severity is positively correlated with higher risk scores for stress-related illness and normal hearing in the high frequencies.",

      "abstract": "Teacher stress and early career attrition represent global challenges in education, yet significant gaps exist in understanding how Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)-based interventions can build resilience in pre-service teachers. While mindfulness and social-emotional learning programs have received attention, few studies have systematically examined CBT workshops for teacher preparation or explored their implications for advancing evaluation methodology in educational contexts. This narrative review addresses these gaps by synthesizing evidence on CBT-based workshops for pre-service teachers while examining contributions to evaluation scholarship. Across diverse cultural and institutional contexts, CBT interventions consistently reduced stress, improved emotional regulation, and enhanced self-efficacy, with immediate benefits and variable long-term outcomes. The mechanistic clarity of CBT's cognitive restructuring approach enables precise measurement of causal pathways, making these interventions particularly suitable for theory-driven evaluation frameworks. The review reveals three critical contributions to evaluation methodology: validation of theory-driven approaches in complex educational settings, demonstration that cultural adaptation enhances program effectiveness without compromising evaluation rigor, and illumination of temporal complexity in preventive interventions. These findings provide lessons for the international evaluation community about implementing and assessing preventive interventions across diverse contexts. This study contributes a novel perspective demonstrating how CBT-based interventions can inform both teacher education program design and advancement of evaluation theory and practice.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Self-compassion is an adaptive means of relating to oneself that encompasses elements of self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness. Self-compassion has positive associations with health and may dampen biological and psychological stress responses, which would be particularly helpful for those with a history of early life adversity. The purpose of this study was to determine i) the association of trait self-compassion with cortisol and affective responses to an acute psychosocial stressor among early adolescents, and ii) whether this association differed by exposure to early life adversity (e.g., abuse, neglect). METHODS: Eighty-three early adolescents (M = 12.86 years; 47\u202f% girls, 1\u202f% non-binary) self-reported their trait self-compassion, completed a structured interview-based assessment to assess threat- and deprivation-related exposures to early life adversity, and underwent a psychosocial laboratory stressor (Trier Social Stress Test for Children; TSST-C). Salivary cortisol and self-reported positive and negative affect were measured at six timepoints before, during, and for 30\u202fmin following the stressor. We tested associations of self-compassion with trajectories (reactivity, recovery) and total levels (area under the curve with respect to ground; AUCg) of cortisol and positive and negative affect across the TSST-C, as well as moderating effects of early life adversity. Hierarchical linear models were used to test trajectories, and linear regression was used to test AUCg, with unstandardized (B) and standardized beta coefficients (\u03b2) reported, respectively. RESULTS: Self-compassion was not associated with total cortisol levels or trajectories of cortisol, positive affect, or negative affect (all p\u202f>\u202f0.057). However, greater self-compassion was associated with higher sample 1 positive affect, B =\u202f1.815, t(71)\u202f=\u202f2.84, p\u202f=\u202f.006, and greater total positive affect levels, \u03b2 =\u202f0.411, t(62)\u202f=\u202f3.90, p\u202f<\u202f.001. Similarly, self-compassion was associated with lower sample 1 negative affect, B =\u202f-1.261, t(72)\u202f=\u202f-2.35, p\u202f=\u202f0.022, and less total negative affect levels, \u03b2 =\u202f-0.269, t(75)\u202f=\u202f-2.45, p\u202f=\u202f0.017. Additionally, sensitivity analyses indicated that at higher levels of early-life threat exposure, greater self-compassion was associated with higher sample 1 positive affect. CONCLUSION: Among adolescents - including those exposed to threat-related forms of early life adversity- self-compassion may impart more general, diffuse beneficial effects on affect rather than buffering affective or cortisol responses to an acute stressor.",
