Mindfulness meditation and loving-kindness meditation have also gained research traction, showing promise for enhancing emotional regulation and psychological well-being. This paper explores the therapeutic convergence of these modalities, highlighting their neurobiological, psychological, and phenomenological overlap, and suggesting potential bidirectional synergy as a foundation for psychedelic or MDMA-assisted therapy.A narrative and theoretical review of the current literature was conducted, examining the neurobiological, psychological, and phenomenological effects of MDMA, psychedelics, and meditation. Studies focusing on their potential synergy and mechanisms of action were prioritized and used as a backing for a theoretical framework.Psychedelics may improve psychological flexibility, prosocial behaviors, empathy, and neuroplasticity. Meditation research suggests similar benefits, including enhanced decentering capacity, emotional regulation, and well-being. Both modalities influence overlapping neural circuitry, particularly the amygdala, hippocampus, and default mode network. Integrating meditation with MDMA or psychedelic-assisted therapy may stabilize insights gained during altered states of consciousness, promote sustained therapeutic benefits, and minimize distress during therapy.The convergence of meditation and psychedelics or MDMA-assisted therapy is a novel and promising approach for enhancing mental health treatments. Future research should investigate structured protocols combining these modalities, focusing on optimizing\u00a0\u201cset and setting\u201d and long-term integration practices.",

      "abstract": "\n\n\nPassive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is an important survey method used to collect data on bat distribution and activity that are needed to underpin conservation and management. The introduction of open\u2010source acoustic recorders at price points considerably lower than those for commercial detectors means PAM is becoming increasingly accessible to practitioners. However, uncertainty regarding recording quality, especially at higher frequencies, makes understanding the comparative performance of commercial and open\u2010source devices imperative.\n\nHere, two types of commercial bat detectors: full spectrum (Anabat Swift) and zero\u2010crossing (Anabat Express), and open\u2010source AudioMoth acoustic recorders (configured to use 250\u2009kHz (hereafter low) or (384\u2009kHz hereafter high) sampling rates) are compared in each of four different habitats: riparian, woodland, wood pasture and arable. In each habitat, comparisons are made using detectors that were spatially co\u2010located and recording on the same nights, such that they had identical opportunity to record the same data. Species accumulation curves were additionally created for each detector type to quantify the combined effects of using multiple detectors, multiple locations per site and multiple temporal replicates.\n\nWhen directly compared, full spectrum commercial detectors outperformed open\u2010source devices (regardless of sampling rate) for many metrics, including for species richness (i.e. the number of species recorded) in all habitats tested. However, the low frequency open\u2010source device performed similarly to the zero\u2010crossing commercial device in quantifying overall bat activity and activity of individual taxa in most habitats. The low frequency open\u2010source unit consistently outperformed the high frequency open\u2010source unit.\n\nCommercial detectors accumulated species more quickly, and one detector at one location per site was typically sufficient to record the full species inventory. However, use of multiple open\u2010source devices over a longer period recorded the same species inventory in three of the four habitats.\n\nPractical implication: Although commercial devices remain the gold standard for recording quality, this study shows that less expensive open\u2010source acoustic recorders sampling at low frequency are viable for PAM where the cost of commercial devices is prohibitive. However, it should be noted that longer survey periods or use of multiple units are often required to obtain comparable data.\n\n",

      "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article frames the Noble Eightfold Path as a rigorously engineered method, a \"technology\" for diagnosing, reducing, and ultimately ceasing dukkha (unsatisfactoriness). Drawing on early discourses, the Path's eight factors are mapped to a three-layer architecture: s\u012bla (ethical reliability) supplies system stability; sam\u0101dhi (collectedness) delivers performance optimization by unifying attention; and pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 (wisdom) functions as the interpretive engine that identifies and corrects root causes. Each factor is articulated as an actionable module with clear inputs (motivations, contexts), processes (skills, protocols), and outputs (observable shifts in reactivity, clarity, and care). The paper details the interdependence of these modules through feedback loops: ethical coherence lowers agitation, enabling sustained Concentration; Concentration clarifies perception, empowering insight; insight, in turn, strengthens ethical resolve. Adopting a practice-based lens, we propose minimal viable protocols, including ten to twenty minutes of daily breath meditation, hourly three-breath check-ins that emphasize vedan\u0101 (feeling tone), concise speech audits before high-stakes conversations, and brief mett\u0101 (goodwill) sessions to counteract ill will. Progress is operationalized through pragmatic proxies rather than mystical benchmarks: reductions in rumination time, conflict frequency, and recovery time from emotional perturbations; increases in prosocial Speech, attentional stability, and baseline goodwill under stress. Methodologically, the argument integrates a close reading of pivotal suttas with contemporary behavioral design principles, yielding an eight-week training plan that prioritizes small, repeatable behaviors and reflective review. The approach aims to preserve doctrinal fidelity while making classical insights portable and testable in ordinary life contexts, such as workplaces, families, and civic spaces, without relying on esoteric states. The article presents the Eightfold Path as an interconnected system rather than a sequential checklist, providing a practical framework for fostering enduring well-being (sukha) and the cessation of suffering (dukkha). This \"technology of liberation\" encourages systematic experimentation and meticulous evaluation, allowing practitioners to cultivate a dependable, empathetic, and sagacious manner of existence through rigorous practice.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores the role of forgetting in the thought of the Korean S\u014fn (Chan in Chin.; Zen in Jpn. \u79aa) master Chinul (\u77e5\u8a25, 1158\u20131210), situating it within broader East Asian philosophical and Buddhist discourses. While the concept of forgetting has often been treated negatively in Western philosophy\u2014as a cognitive failure or loss\u2014this study draws on recent comparative scholarship, including Youru Wang\u2019s reading of Zhuangzi, to show how forgetting can be reframed as a conscious spiritual and philosophical practice. In particular, this paper examines how Chinul integrates the practice of forgetting into a systematic Buddhist framework grounded in no-self (an\u0101tman), emptiness (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101), and the unity of sam\u0101dhi and praj\u00f1\u0101. In Straight Talk on the True Mind (Chinsim chiks\u014fl \u771e\u5fc3\u76f4\u8aaa), Chinul outlines ten distinct methods for cultivating no-mind by offering interpretations of teachings from various East Asian Chan masters. Through a detailed analysis of Chinul\u2019s Chinsim chiks\u014fl, this paper argues that forgetting\u2014when understood as the deliberate letting go of discursive thought, deluded conceptualizations, and habitual dualisms\u2014becomes a powerful method for revealing the true mind. Ultimately, Chinul\u2019s philosophy of forgetting offers a unique account of cognitive transformation\u2014one that challenges conventional epistemologies and calls for a reorientation of perception itself. Therefore, Chinul\u2019s teachings on no-mind and forgetting offer a profound understanding of how deconstructing ingrained cognitive habits can lead to the emergence of enlightened awareness, providing valuable insights into the transformative processes at the heart of East Asian S\u014fn Buddhist practice.",

This paper introduces an empirical study of ethical education in Buddhist philosophy through an examination of the Mahaprajapati School of Vaishali. This study explores the ethical ideals, pedagogical methods, and philosophical foundations of this school. This paper argues that the Mahaprajapati School followed the path of an early model of value-oriented education, integrating moral discipline (sila), meditative practice (samadhi), and wisdom (panna) within a structured monastic environment. This study highlights the relevance of this ethical educational model for present scenario discussions on moral education and gender inclusivity.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Late-life loneliness is a serious public health concern, yet the long-term efficacy and mechanisms of interventions to alleviate it remain underexplored. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 12-month effectiveness of lay counselor-delivered, telephone-based behavioral activation and mindfulness interventions in reducing loneliness and enhancing well-being among at-risk older adults and to examine whether social isolation mediates these effects. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Helping Alleviate Loneliness in Hong Kong Older Adults (HEAL-HOA) was a 3-arm, assessor-blinded randomized clinical trial conducted from April 1, 2021, to April 28, 2024. Eligible participants 65 years or older who were living alone, digitally excluded, lonely, and experiencing financial hardship were recruited from public housing estates, community centers, academies for older adults, and word of mouth. Participants were randomized 1:1:1 to receive telephone-delivered behavioral activation (Tele-BA), telephone-delivered mindfulness (Tele-MF), or telephone-delivered befriending (Tele-BF [attention control]). INTERVENTIONS: Participants received eight 30-minute sessions delivered by trained lay counselors via telephone for 4 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was loneliness, measured using the UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS) and the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (DJGL). Secondary outcomes included perceived stress, social support, sleep quality, life satisfaction, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and psychological well-being. Social isolation was examined as a mediator. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Of 4152 individuals screened, 1151 participants (mean [SD] age, 76.6 [7.8] years; 843 [73.2%] female; 965 [83.8%] with \u22651 chronic illness) were randomized (Tele-BA, 335 [29.1%]; Tele-MF, 460 [40.0%]; Tele-BF, 356 [30.9%]). Intention-to-treat analyses using linear mixed-effects models showed significant between-group changes in loneliness at 12 months for Tele-BA (UCLA-LS: mean difference [MD], -0.73; 95% CI, -1.29 to -0.16; P\u2009=\u2009.01; DJGL: MD, -0.13; 95% CI, -0.23 to -0.03; P\u2009=\u2009.01) and Tele-MF (UCLA-LS: MD, -0.72; 95% CI, -1.24 to -0.20; P\u2009=\u2009.003) compared with Tele-BF. Secondary outcomes, including sleep quality, psychological well-being, and life satisfaction, also improved significantly. Social isolation at 6 months partially mediated the effect on loneliness (UCLA-LS) for both interventions at 12 months (accounting for 0.13 [13.5%] and 0.18 [18.0%] of the total effects for Tele-BA and Tele-MF, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, brief telephone-delivered behavioral activation and mindfulness interventions by lay counselors sustainably reduced loneliness and enhanced well-being during 12 months in at-risk older adults, with social isolation as a partial mediator. These scalable interventions offered effective solutions for combating late-life loneliness. Future research should investigate the applicability of these interventions outside the Hong Kong context as well as their cost-effectiveness. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Identifier: ChiCTR2300072909.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Improving sleep is critical for optimizing short-term and long-term health. Although in-person meditation training has been shown to impact sleep positively, there is a gap in our understanding of whether apps that teach self-guided meditation are also effective. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to test whether Headspace (Headspace, Inc) improves sleep quality, tiredness, sleep duration, and sleep efficiency. METHODS: Staff employees (N=135; mean age 38.1, SD 10.9; 75.0% female; 59.3% non-Hispanic White; 27.1% Hispanic) from a university in California's San Joaquin Valley participated in the study. Participants were randomized to complete 10 minutes of daily meditation via the Headspace app for 8 weeks or waitlist control. Sleep assessments were taken for 4 consecutive days at baseline, and then for 4-day bursts at 2, 5, and 8 weeks after randomization. Sleep quality and subjective sleep duration were assessed each morning with a sleep diary, tiredness was assessed throughout the day using ecological momentary assessment, and objective sleep duration and efficiency were measured using a Fitbit Charge 2. RESULTS: Both subjective and objective sleep outcomes improved. For subjective sleep outcomes, multilevel modeling revealed that those in the Headspace condition, compared to the control group, reported better sleep quality at sessions 2 (\u03b2=0.48, SE=0.12; P<.001), 5 (\u03b2=0.91, SE=0.13; P<.001), and 8 (\u03b2=0.69, SE=0.15; P<.001) compared to baseline, and a decrease in tiredness at session 5 (\u03b2=-0.58, SE=0.19; P=.001) compared to baseline, but not at sessions 2 or 8. For objective sleep outcomes, those in the Headspace condition compared to the control group had longer sleep durations at session 5 (\u03b2=23.96, SE=12.19; P=.04) compared to baseline, but not at sessions 2 or 8. There were no significant effects for sleep efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: This study continues adding to the ever-developing field of mobile health apps by demonstrating that Headspace can positively impact sleep quality, tiredness, and duration.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Maternal suboptimal nutrition and high stress levels are associated with altered fetal cardiovascular function. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effect of structured maternal lifestyle interventions based on a Mediterranean diet or mindfulness-based stress reduction during pregnancy on fetal cardiac function. STUDY DESIGN: This was a secondary analysis of the IMPACT BCN (Improving Mothers for a better PrenAtal Care Trial BarCeloNa) randomized clinical trial, which was conducted at a university hospital in Barcelona, Spain, from February 2017 to March 2020. A total of 1221 singleton pregnancies (19-23 weeks' gestation) with high risk of delivering small-for-gestational-age newborns were randomly allocated into 3 groups in a 1:1:1 ratio: a Mediterranean diet intervention, a stress reduction program, or usual care. Participants in the Mediterranean diet group received monthly individual and group educational sessions and free provision of extra-virgin olive oil and walnuts. Those in the stress reduction group underwent an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program adapted for pregnancy. Individuals in the usual care group received pregnancy care per institutional protocols. Fetal cardiac function was assessed using cord blood NT-proBNP (N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide) and fetal echocardiography. NT-proBNP was measured in cord blood collected at delivery and considered high if >90 RESULTS: Fetal echocardiography and cord blood NT-proBNP measurements were obtained in 990 and 746 pregnancies, respectively. Whereas fetuses in the stress reduction group showed similar fetal cardiac results, the proportion of fetuses with high cord blood NT-proBNP concentrations was significantly lower in the Mediterranean diet group (6.4% vs 12%; P=.03) compared with the usual care group. Additionally, fetuses whose mothers followed the Mediterranean diet exhibited higher right ventricular fractional area change (mean [standard deviation], 30.4% [8.3] vs 28.1% [8.9]; P=.03) and thinner myocardial walls (mean [standard deviation], 2.95 [0.55] vs 3.16 [0.58] mm; P=.006) compared with the usual care group. CONCLUSION: Promotion of a maternal Mediterranean diet intervention during pregnancy seems to be associated with a less overloaded and more efficient fetal heart. Future research is warranted to elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying these findings.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based interventions have been applied across various chronic illnesses, but no tailored program exists for individuals with pulmonary hypertension (PH). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and evaluate the feasibility of a mindfulness-based self-management program for patients with PH, delivered online to accommodate their limited mobility. METHODS: A single-arm pre-post study was conducted using an 8-session, weekly videoconference program incorporating PH self-management education and elements of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. A mobile app linked to an Apple Watch was used to support symptom monitoring and mindfulness awareness. Outcomes included PH-related symptoms, quality of life (emPHasis-10), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale [GAD-7]), resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale [CD-RISC]), and loneliness (UCLA Loneliness Scale-short version). Assessments occurred at baseline, week 4, and program completion. Exit interviews explored perceived changes and experiences. RESULTS: Twelve participants (mean age 41.8, SD 10.5 years; range 26-56 years) were enrolled, and 9 completed the program (75% retention). Participants valued the online format and Apple Watch integration, while noting a need for optional on-demand sessions. Qualitative analysis identified themes such as increased self-awareness, use of meditation for pain management, and enhanced self-compassion. Quantitative analysis showed significant changes across 3 time points (baseline, week 4, and week 8) for emPHasis-10 (\u03c7\u00b2\u2082=9.74; P=.008) and CD-RISC (\u03c7\u00b2\u2082=7.27; P=.03). Trends toward change were observed for PHQ-9 (\u03c7\u00b2\u2082=4.75; P=.09) and GAD-7 (\u03c7\u00b2\u2082=5.07; P=.08), but week 12 data were limited (n=5). No significant changes in loneliness were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The program appeared to support patients with PH in managing symptoms and emotions and suggested potential improvements in quality of life. These preliminary findings warrant evaluation in a future randomized controlled trial.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is promising evidence for the adaptation of online mindfulness interventions for parent carers of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities by including supplementary peer support sessions. However, there remain questions about wider implementation beyond the research setting and the inclusion of more diverse populations of family caregivers, including adult siblings and family carers who less typically receive support and are often under-represented in research. METHOD: One hundred and one family carers (n\u2009=\u200958 parents, n\u2009=\u200943 adult siblings) were provided with access to Be Mindful (an online mindfulness intervention) with additional telephone peer mentor support. Participants were asked to complete baseline and follow-up questionnaires before and after the intervention in a pre-post pre-experimental design, and engagement with the intervention and peer support was examined. RESULTS: Recruitment was successful in targeting more diverse groups, including adult siblings. Intervention completion was low overall (n\u2009=\u200937). Parent and sibling carers made differing levels of progress with the intervention and peer support calls, although 81.8% of those who completed the intervention before the end of the project had also received all three support calls. Preliminary follow-up data, though with low retention, indicated improvements in psychological wellbeing for family carers over time. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention and additional telephone-guided support were received well by family carers of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, although further work is needed to determine the feasibility of future implementation.",

      "abstract": "Children around ages 5-6 begin valuing social mindfulness, where one leaves a diverse choice for others when selecting an item for themselves. This study investigated how Han Chinese 4- to 9-year-olds and adults may consider protagonists' preference (unknown, preferring the unique, or identical items) in their evaluations of socially mindful actions. Results show that, with age, children increasingly rate leaving a choice as nicer, both when the protagonist's preference is unknown and for the unique item. However, when the protagonist prefers identical items, neither children nor adults differentially evaluate between leaving a choice or not. Additionally, children become increasingly sensitive to the costs associated with preferences when evaluating mindful actions. They increasingly evaluated high-cost actions (sacrificing one's preferred item) most favourably, followed by unknown-cost actions, and low-cost actions (when preference aligns with leaving a choice) least favourably. These findings highlighted children's growing ability to integrate complex understandings of preference and cost into social evaluations.",

      "abstract": "University students commonly experience high levels of stress, which negatively impacts on academic performance, engagement and well-being. Coping strategies can be employed to manage stress, but there have not been extensive examinations of student motivations for selecting coping strategies and how selection of strategies changes during a semester. This study explored sources of stress and coping strategies used by first-year undergraduate students across a semester. It examined reasons for strategy selection, and the relationships between coping strategies, academic engagement and performance. Participants were 203 consenting first-year undergraduate sport science students in Australia. Students responded to open-ended questions at the beginning and end of semester, and responses were subjected to thematic analysis. Frequencies of responses were correlated with measures of engagement and academic performance. The primary sources of stress were academic pressures, alongside social, financial, and personal challenges. At the beginning of semester, students predominantly intended to employ problem-focused coping strategies, such as time management and study techniques. However, by the semester's end, students more frequently reported using strategies such as exercise, balancing work and life, meditation and yoga. Students' reported reasons for strategy use indicated that coping mechanisms served dual functions, both alleviating emotional distress and supporting study effectiveness, regardless of whether traditionally classified as problem- or emotion-focused. Employing more coping strategies positively correlated with higher academic performance. These findings suggest that encouraging a diverse range of adaptive coping strategies, while considering students' motivations for strategy selection, can support students' academic success and well-being.",

The Exercise and Self\u2011Esteem Model with Self\u2011Compassion (EXSEM\u2011SC) highlights the roles of exercise self\u2011efficacy and body compassion in fostering self\u2011compassion, but it does not address the contributions of mindfulness and interoceptive body awareness in mitigating self\u2011criticism associated with discomfort, inadequacy, or doubt during activity.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This feasibility study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of a simplified, app-based mindfulness intervention for people with epilepsy (PWE) in mainland China. METHODS: Ten adults with epilepsy completed a 6-week, self-guided mindfulness program (15\u202fmin/day, 6\u202fdays/week) delivered via a WeChat mini-program. Feasibility was measured by program completion rates and an acceptability questionnaire. Exploratory pre-post assessments included quality of life (QOLIE-31), anxiety (GAD-7), depression (NDDI-E), trait mindfulness (MAAS), and seizure frequency. Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, effect size estimators (Cliff's \u03b4, Hodges-Lehmann), Bayes factors, minimal clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds and descriptive statistics were employed. RESULTS: The intervention demonstrated high feasibility, with a mean program completion rate of 110.1% and positive user feedback. Exploratory analyses noted improvements in quality of life (QOLIE-31 median difference = +9.12) and anxiety (GAD-7 median difference\u202f=\u202f-5.50). No inferential testing was performed for seizure frequency, but a descriptive median reduction of 1.17 seizures per 4\u202fweeks was observed, with 50% of participants achieving a\u202f\u2265\u202f50% reduction. CONCLUSIONS: A brief, app-based mindfulness intervention is feasible and acceptable for PWE in mainland China. This finding supports the rationale for a future randomized controlled trial to rigorously evaluate its efficacy within a stepped-care model.",

Participants were then subjected to three different simulation scenarios, during which their physiological responses and brain waves were recorded.ResultsResults indicated that effort scored the highest and failure the lowest among the dimensions assessed. Notably, the average heart rate increased from 74.33 beats per minute at rest to 85.92 after the second scenario, signifying heightened physiological stress. Post-scenario analyses showed an increase in attention and alertness levels compared to the resting state, while meditation levels decreased. Physiological responses, including heart rate and blood pressure, were found to elevate after rest periods, correlating with decreased attention and increased mental workload, as evidenced by the BN findings.ConclusionsThese results underscore the intricate interplay between physiological responses and cognitive performance, highlighting the critical need for targeted strategies to mitigate human errors in maritime operations.",
