      "abstract": "Understanding consciousness requires bridging theoretical models and clinically measurable brain dynamics. This review integrates three complementary frameworks that converge on a dynamical view of conscious processing: continuous formulations of Integrated Information Theory (IIT), attractor-landscape modeling of brain-state transitions, and perturbational complexity metrics from transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG). Continuous-time IIT formalizes how integrated information evolves across temporal hierarchies, while dynamical-systems approaches show that consciousness emerges near criticality, where metastable attractors enable flexible transitions between partially synchronized states. Perturbational-complexity indices capture these properties empirically, quantifying the brain\u2019s capacity for integration and differentiation even without behavioral responsiveness. Across anesthesia, disorders of consciousness, epilepsy, and neurodegeneration, TMS-EEG biomarkers reveal reduced complexity and altered synchronization consistent with structural and functional disconnection. Integrating multimodal data\u2014diffusion MRI, fMRI, EEG, and causal perturbations\u2014is consistent with individualized modeling of consciousness-related dynamics. Standardized protocols, mechanistically interpretable machine learning, and longitudinal validation are essential for clinical translation. By uniting information-theoretic, dynamical, and empirical perspectives, this framework offers a reproducible foundation for consciousness biomarkers that mechanistically link brain dynamics to subjective experience, paving the way for precision applications in neurology, psychiatry, and anesthesia.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools for educational purposes is rapidly becoming widespread. Having a negative attitude may lead to the failure of the integration of these tools. Therefore, it is important to explore the factors that affect students\u2019 attitudes towards GenAI tools. In this context, our current study aims to explore the relationship between self-regulated learning skills (SRLS), cognitive flexibility, metacognitive awareness and students\u2019 GenAI attitude. In this direction, a correlational study was conducted on 761 university students with GenAI experience, and structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis was performed. Our findings as a result of the analysis show that SRLS and cognitive flexibility have a significant positive effect on GenAI attitudes. In addition, metacognitive awareness is understood to indirectly affect GenAI attitudes by affecting SRLS and cognitive flexibility. These results reveal the importance of SRLS, cognitive flexibility and metacognitive awareness in promoting positive attitudes towards GenAI tools.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are currently the most common mental health condition. The initial development of evidence-based therapy (EBT) led to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) as the gold standard treatment for anxiety disorders. However, newer EBTs that incorporate acceptance and mindfulness-based techniques have also shown efficacy for many individuals with anxiety. This review describes the evolution of CBT, as well as the transition to a newer wave of EBTs, including dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and mindfulness-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (MBCT). The importance of transdiagnostic and individualized treatments are discussed, in addition to alternative treatments of anxiety. Future research related to treatment for anxiety will continue to focus on the development and refinement of EBTs for anxiety disorders.",

      "abstract": "Background In biomedical and health sciences, many articles are published open access (OA). OA publication rates continue to grow, especially for pharmaceutical research. Previous analyses of pharmaceutical OA publication rates were labor-intensive and not easily automated. We aimed to create a free, live, online dashboard comparing OA publication rates between pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. Methods Using the Lens \u2013 an online platform aggregating full-text content and metadata for over 280 million scholarly works \u2013 we built a dashboard showing OA publication rates for medical research articles by authors from the top 40 pharmaceutical companies (pharma) and 40 research-intensive academic institutions (academia). The dashboard details OA rates by model, license and therapy area across three time frames: 12\u201324 months; 0\u201312 months; 0\u201310 years. We downloaded data from the dashboard between 24 July and 4 August 2023 and performed further analysis. Results Of the articles published 12\u201324 months before data extraction, 76.6% by pharma and 69.5% by academia were OA. The most common OA models were gold (pharma, 37%; academia, 41%) and hybrid (pharma, 22%; academia, 11%). Oncology had lower rates of OA articles than other therapy areas. In the 10 years before data extraction, growth in the OA publication rate was generally more rapid for pharmaceutical companies than for academic institutions, regardless of field (change in overall % OA 2013\u20132023: pharma, 3.1; academia, 1.6). Conclusions This dashboard provides novel and regularly updated evidence on the comparative OA publication practices of pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. In our snapshot analysis, the OA publication rate was higher for pharmaceutical companies than for academic institutions and continues to increase. Notable differences were observed in approaches, in terms of licenses and OA models, which may reflect different institutional practices and circumstances. We encourage others to use this open resource for new research and to report their results.",

      "abstract": "Slope failures in open-pit mining pose significant operational and safety issues, underscoring the importance of implementing effective stability monitoring frameworks for early hazard detection to allow for timely intervention and risk mitigation. This systematic review presents a comprehensive synthesis of existing and emerging methods and technologies used for slope stability monitoring in open-pit mining, including both remote sensing and in situ methods, as well as advanced technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines, a total of 49 studies were selected from a collection of four engineering databases, and a comparative analysis was conducted to determine the underlying differences between the various methods for open-pit slope stability monitoring in terms of their performance across key attributes, such as monitoring accuracy, spatial and temporal coverage, operational complexity, and economic viability. Their juxtaposition highlighted the notion that no universally optimal slope stability monitoring system exists, due to a series of compromises that arise as a result of inherent technological limitations and site-specific constraints. Notably, remote sensing methods offer large-scale, non-intrusive monitoring, but are often limited by environmental factors and data acquisition infrequency, whereas in situ methods provide high precision, but suffer from limited spatial coverage and scalability. This review further highlights the capacity of emerging methods and technologies to address these limitations, providing suggestions for future research directions involving the integration of multiple sensing technologies for the enhancement of monitoring capabilities. This study provides a consolidated knowledge base on open-pit slope stability monitoring methods, technologies, and techniques, to guide the development of integrated, cost-effective, and scalable slope monitoring solutions that enhance mine safety and efficiency.",

      "abstract": "\n\n\nDrones have become invaluable tools for studying animal behaviour in the wild, enabling researchers to collect aerial video data of group\u2010living animals. However, manually piloting drones to track animal groups consistently is challenging due to complex factors such as terrain, vegetation, group spread and movement patterns. The variability in manual piloting can result in unusable data for downstream behavioural analysis, making it difficult to collect standardized datasets for studying collective animal behaviour.\n\nTo address these challenges, we present WildWing, a complete hardware and software open\u2010source unmanned aerial system (UAS) for autonomously collecting behavioural video data of group\u2010living animals. The system's main goal is to automate and standardize the collection of high\u2010quality aerial footage suitable for computer vision\u2010based behaviour analysis. We provide a novel navigation policy to autonomously track animal groups while maintaining optimal camera angles and distances for behavioural analysis, reducing the inconsistencies inherent in manual piloting.\n\nThe complete WildWing system costs only $650 and incorporates drone hardware with custom software that integrates ecological knowledge into autonomous navigation decisions. The system produces 4\u2009K resolution video at 30 fps while automatically maintaining appropriate distances and angles for behaviour analysis. We validate the system through field deployments tracking groups of Grevy's zebras, giraffes and Przewalski's horses at The Wilds conservation centre, demonstrating its ability to collect usable behavioural data consistently.\n\nBy automating the data collection process, WildWing helps ensure consistent, high\u2010quality video data suitable for computer vision analysis of animal behaviour. This standardization is crucial for developing robust automated behaviour recognition systems to help researchers study and monitor wildlife populations at scale. The open\u2010source nature of WildWing makes autonomous behavioural data collection more accessible to researchers, enabling wider application of drone\u2010based behavioural monitoring in conservation and ecological research.\n\n",

      "abstract": "This review discusses the evolution and integration of open-access remote sensing technology in shoreline detection and coastal erosion monitoring through the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and Ground Truth Data (GTD). The Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 missions are highlighted as the primary core datasets due to their open-access policy, worldwide coverage, and demonstrated applicability in long-term coastal monitoring. Landsat data have allowed the detection of multi-decadal trends in erosion since 1972, and Sentinel-2 has provided enhanced spatial and temporal resolutions since 2015. Through integration with GIS programs such as the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), AI-based processes such as sophisticated models including WaterNet, U-Net, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are highly accurate in shoreline segmentation. UAVs supply complementary high-resolution data for localized validation, and ground truthing based on GNSS increases the precision of the produced map results. The fusion of UAV imagery, satellite data, and machine learning aids a multi-resolution approach to real-time shoreline monitoring and early warnings. Despite the developments seen with these tools, issues relating to atmosphere such as cloud cover, data fusion, and model generalizability in different coastal environments continue to require resolutions to be addressed by future studies in terms of enhanced sensors and adaptive learning approaches with the rise of AI technology the recent years.",

      "abstract": "Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is crucial for plant growth, influencing photosynthesis efficiency and crop yield. The increasing adoption of controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) necessitates precise PAR monitoring. The high cost of commercial PAR sensors, however, limits their accessibility and widespread use, creating a growing need for a low-cost alternative capable of reliable deployment in diverse agricultural environments. Building on recent advancements in PAR sensing using multi-channel spectral sensors such as the AS7341 and AS7265, this study develops the electronics for an AS7341-based, open-source, cost-effective (~USD 50) PAR sensor validated across a broad PPFD range and conditions, ensuring reliability and ease of replication. It uses a relatively simple multi-linear regression that offers real-time applications without energy intensive machine learning. The developed sensor is calibrated against the industry-standard Apogee SQ-500SS PAR sensor in four distinct farming environments: (i) horizontal grow lights, (ii) vertical agrotunnel lighting, (iii) agrivoltaics, and (iv) in greenhouses. A mean error ranging from 1 to 5% indicates its suitability for controlled environment farming and continuous data logging. The open-source hardware design and systematic installation guidelines enable users to replicate, calibrate, and integrate the sensor with minimal background in electronics and optics.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Open-pit coal mining poses a severe threat to regional ecological security. Rapid and accurate monitoring of ecological quality changes is crucial for regional ecological restoration. In this study, taking the Wujiata open-pit coal mine as an example, the Red-Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (RENDVI), Salinity Index (SI-T), WETness index (WET), Normalized Differential Built Soil Index (NDBSI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), and Desertification Index (DI) were used to construct the Open-pit Mine Remote Sensing Ecological Index (OM-RSEI) through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The ecological quality and restoration conditions of typical mining areas in arid and semi-arid regions were monitored and evaluated. The results shown that: (1) The contribution rates and eigenvalues of OM-RSEI were higher than those of conventional RSEI, OM-RSEI was more applicable in open-pit mining areas. (2) From 2018 to 2023, the OM-RSEI of the Wujiata open-pit coal mine showed a \u2018V\u2019 shaped fluctuation that was damaged and then gradually recovered. (3) The degraded area of Wujiata open-pit coal mine and its 5\u2009km buffer zone accounted for 78.02%, and the improved area accounted for 19.16%. (4) The average Moran\u2019s I index of OM-RSEI in the study area was 0.8189, and the high\u2013high clustering corresponded to the \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018excellent\u2019 distributions, while the low\u2013low clustering corresponded to the \u2018poor\u2019 and \u2018less-poor\u2019 distributions. The OM-RSEI provided a new indicator for monitoring and evaluation of ecological restoration in open-pit coal mines, which can provide theoretical support for ecological restoration in open-pit coal mining areas.",

      "abstract": "Global biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate, yet little information is known about most species and how their populations are changing. Indeed, some 90% of Earth's species are estimated to be completely unknown. Machine learning has recently emerged as a promising tool to facilitate long-term, large-scale biodiversity monitoring, including algorithms for fine-grained classification of species from images. However, such algorithms typically are not designed to detect examples from categories unseen during training -- the problem of open-set recognition (OSR) -- limiting their applicability for highly diverse, poorly studied taxa such as insects. To address this gap, we introduce Open-Insect, a large-scale, fine-grained dataset to evaluate unknown species detection across different geographic regions with varying difficulty. We benchmark 38 OSR algorithms across three categories: post-hoc, training-time regularization, and training with auxiliary data, finding that simple post-hoc approaches remain a strong baseline. We also demonstrate how to leverage auxiliary data to improve species discovery in regions with limited data. Our results provide insights to guide the development of computer vision methods for biodiversity monitoring and species discovery.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Monitoring environmental components at the land-water interface is very important for understanding as well as assessing dynamic hydrological and geomorphological processes. Such components include open-cast mines undergoing water reclamation. Three-dimensional modeling of these changing landscapes is essential to understand the dynamics of the water surface and to guide the safe reclamation process. Existing approaches often do not effectively integrate data from different platforms and sensors. This study presents a combined remote sensing technique that utilizes imagery and LiDAR-based data from UAVs, airborne, and satellite platforms to support the mapping of flooded mine. The proposed workflow involves data fusion, multi-temporal analysis, and 3D reconstruction to detect morphological changes, monitor hydrodynamic behaviour, and predict future flood scenarios. The results show that the combination of data from active and passive sensors significantly improves spatial and temporal resolution, enabling accurate and detailed modeling.\n",

      "abstract": "The construction industry increasingly relies on visual data to support Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications for site monitoring. High-quality, domain-specific datasets, comprising images, videos, and point clouds, capture site geometry and spatiotemporal dynamics, including the location and interaction of objects, workers, and materials. However, despite growing interest in leveraging visual datasets, existing resources vary widely in sizes, data modalities, annotation quality, and representativeness of real-world construction conditions. A systematic review to categorize their data characteristics and application contexts is still lacking, limiting the community's ability to fully understand the dataset landscape, identify critical gaps, and guide future directions toward more effective, reliable, and scalable AI applications in construction. To address this gap, this study conducts an extensive search of academic databases and open-data platforms, yielding 51 publicly available visual datasets that span the 2005-2024 period. These datasets are categorized using a structured data schema covering (i) data fundamentals (e.g., size and license), (ii) data modalities (e.g., RGB and point cloud), (iii) annotation frameworks (e.g., bounding boxes), and (iv) downstream application domains (e.g., progress tracking). This study synthesizes these findings into an open-source catalog, OpenConstruction, supporting data-driven method development. Furthermore, the study discusses several critical limitations in the existing construction dataset landscape and presents a roadmap for future data infrastructure anchored in the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles. By reviewing the current landscape and outlining strategic priorities, this study supports the advancement of data-centric solutions in the construction sector.",

      "abstract": "DeepSeek-R1 has shown that long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can naturally emerge through a simple reinforcement learning (RL) framework with rule-based rewards, where the training may directly start from the base models-a paradigm referred to as zero RL training. Most recent efforts to reproduce zero RL training have primarily focused on the Qwen2.5 model series, which may not be representative as we find the base models already exhibit strong instruction-following and self-reflection abilities. In this work, we investigate zero RL training across 10 diverse base models, spanning different families and sizes including LLama3-8B, Mistral-7B/24B, DeepSeek-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-math-7B, and all Qwen2.5 models from 0.5B to 32B. Leveraging several key design strategies-such as adjusting format reward and controlling query difficulty-we achieve substantial improvements in both reasoning accuracy and response length across most settings. However, by carefully monitoring the training dynamics, we observe that different base models exhibit distinct patterns during training. For instance, the increased response length does not always correlate with the emergence of certain cognitive behaviors such as verification (i.e., the\"aha moment\"). Notably, we observe the\"aha moment\"for the first time in small models not from the Qwen family. We share the key designs that enable successful zero RL training, along with our findings and practices. To facilitate further research, we open-source the code, models, and analysis tools.",

Assessing marine megafauna trajectories is traditionally performed with significantly high cost and labor, without guaranteeing the equipment recapture, where quick georeferencing techniques remain proprietary and power intensive. The Internet of Things (IoT) and open radio communication protocols, such as long range (LoRa), provide opportunities for the creation of robust and low-cost sensor networks, which still need to be further tested in the harsh oceanic environment and on marine species. With a vision on having their real-life application on marine species, this study provides a fourfold contribution with LoRa and IoT. First, we review current biotelemetry and biologging, outlining opportunities. Second, we present TRITON, an open telemetry sensor for marine megafauna monitoring. Third, we provide a novel location estimation pipeline based on assisted GPS and simplified pseudorange multilateration using raw satellite data. Fourth, we validate the location estimation pipeline with four in-the-wild studies, mimicking the behavior of marine species, obtaining $\\text{500}\\;\\text{m}$ grand average error, using seven satellites. We discuss how the TRITON system may be leveraged for long- and short-term marine megafauna monitoring, paving the road for more LoRa and IoT biotelemetry applications.",

      "abstract": "The traditional process monitoring method follows a static learning paradigm based on closed-set assumptions. However, with new modes constantly emerging, static models are limited to generalizing known modes. If new mode data is used to update the model, it can result in catastrophic forgetting. Existing solutions require strong similarity between modes, severely limiting industrial applications. In response to these issues, this article proposes a dynamic dictionary learning paradigm for open multimode process monitoring. First, within a probabilistic framework, the general form of the regularization constraint is derived as a standard quadratic form based on parameter weights, which is applicable to most monitoring frameworks. The optimization sensitivity weight is defined, and an analytical expression is derived to accurately memorize the important parameters of multiple modes. Then, for low similarity of modes, a mode information diversity perception-based sampling method is proposed. Based on this, a few-shot replay mechanism is introduced to memorize the direct features of historical modes, thereby reinforcing representational ability. The complementary dual memory of atoms and samples overcomes the mode similarity constraint. Finally, A benchmark evaluation protocol for continual monitoring of the open multimode process is proposed for the first time. A numerical simulation system and an industrial wheel production system verified the superiority.",

      "abstract": "Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) is re-shaping mobile network architecture by promoting openness, disaggregation, and cross-vendor interoperability. However, this architectural flexibility introduces new security challenges, espe-cially in deployments where multiple mobile network operators (MNOs) jointly operate shared components. Existing Zero Trust Architectures (ZTA) in O-RAN, as defined by governmental and industry standards, implicitly assume that authenticated components will comply with operational policies. However, this assumption creates a critical blind spot: misconfigured or compro-mised components can silently violate policies, misuse resources, or corrupt downstream processes (e.g., ML-based RIC xApps). To address this critical gap, we propose a monitoring frame-work for low-trust O-RAN environments that proactively verifies configuration state and control behavior against tenant-defined policies. Our system provides scalable, verifiable oversight to enhance transparency and trust in O-RAN operations. We im-plement and evaluate the framework using standardized O-RAN configurations, with total processing latency of approximately 200 ms, demonstrating its efficiency and practicality for timely policy enforcement and compliance auditing in multi-MNO deployments.",

      "abstract": "HighlightsA mobile robot was designed to autonomously cruise in typical commercial chicken farms in Taiwan.The localization of the robot reached a mean absolute error of 0.17 m.The mobile robot automatically monitored the open-mouth behavior of chickens.A trained YOLO v7 model achieved an AP of 86.1% in the detection of chickens with open-mouth behavior.The analysis indicates that the open-mouth behavior ratio was correlated to ambient temperature.Abstract. In the conventional management of commercial floor-rearing chicken farms, farmers regularly patrol to observe chicken status and to check the environment. For countries with a subtropical climate (e.g., Taiwan), heat stress (HS) is a common environmental stressor for chickens due to high temperature and humidity. Open-mouth behavior (OMB) of chickens is an indicator of HS and is closely monitored in patrols. Manual patrols are laborious and time-consuming. Moreover, frequent patrols may increase the risk of pathogen spread while entering and exiting chicken farms. Therefore, this study developed a mobile robot to autonomously patrol in chicken farms and to automatically monitor OMB of chickens. Considering the commercial chicken farms in Taiwan usually have narrow aisles between feed buckets, a compact robot was designed. An ultra-wideband (UWB) module was utilized to localize the mobile robot. The mobile robot performed navigation and obstacle avoidance using a depth camera and the navigation stack of the Robot Operating System (ROS). For monitoring OMB of chickens, an image acquisition component was developed to acquire chicken images. A YOLO v7 model was trained to detect the chickens with OMB in the collected images. Subsequently, OMB ratios, defined as the ratios of chickens with OMB, were calculated to quantify this behavior. Experimental results showed that the mean absolute error of the UWB was 0.17 m in robot localization, complying with the requirements for navigating the robot in the narrow aisles of chicken farms. The trained YOLO v7 model achieved an average precision of 86.1%. Experimental results indicated that the mean OMB ratios between summer and winter were significantly different. In addition, the OMB ratio and temperature in summer were found to be moderately and positively correlated, indicating that OMB ratio was an effective indicator to represent chicken behaviors under different temperatures. The developed mobile robot provides a solution to automate the regular patrols performed by chicken farmers.

      "abstract": "The Longtantian coal mine is a nationally significant large-scale coal mine in China and is listed as one of the Yunnan Province\u2019s coal mines for supply assurance and capacity increase, but extensive mining has caused significant surface deformation, posing safety hazards. High-precision monitoring and prediction of surface deformation are essential. This study used the small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar technique to extract surface deformation time-series data from Sentinel-1A images between 4 January 2020 and 19 January 2024. Considering the spatiotemporal heterogeneity, dynamic time warping based K-means clustering analysis was applied to divide the area into subspaces with similar deformation trends. A convolutional neural network optimized bidirectional long short-term memory (CNN-BiLSTM) prediction model was constructed using lithological properties (described by internal friction angle and cohesion), fault distance, rainfall, and deformation data. Results showed an annual deformation rate of \u201386.96\u201350.42 mm/year. The F2, F3, and F4 faults, the third section of the Longtan Formation (P2l3) and the Quaternary (Q) lithological units, rainfall and historical deformation have all had an impact on the surface deformation of the mining area. The experimental results show that the CNN-BiLSTM architecture has significantly improved prediction accuracy compared to the basic LSTM model. The prediction error distribution of the original LSTM model is in the range of [\u2013196.55, 106.91] mm, while the improved CNN-BiLSTM model reduces the error range to the range of [\u201358.22, 74.33] mm, with extreme error values reduced by 70.40% and 30.47%, respectively. Therefore, the research results can provide scientific data support for disaster prevention and reduction of Longtantian Coal mine, and provide reference for monitoring and forecasting of other mining areas.",

      "abstract": "Establishing the first Human Milk Bank (HMB) in Vietnam at the Da Nang Hospital for Women and Children marks a significant advancement in neonatal care. This specialized service addresses the critical need for donor human milk (DHM) when a mother's own milk is unavailable, providing essential nutrition to small vulnerable newborns. Introducing the new specialized service required developing a digital monitoring system to ensure the quality and safety of DHM. This digital and open access system was designed using an approach called DMADV (Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, and Verify), and includes features for human milk donor management, DHM processing, recipient management, and real-time data access. It has streamlined operations, enhanced efficiency, and ensured adherence to safety and quality standards. The application of the monitoring system has facilitated the tracking of DHM from collection to use, ensuring transparency and accountability. Data collected through this system has been instrumental in improving program performance, informing decisions, and supporting research. The successful scaling up of HMB services and the monitoring system to other regions in Vietnam demonstrates the project's effectiveness and potential for broader impact. The system's adaptability has allowed continuous improvements and integration of new functions, such as financial reporting and consumables tracking. Lessons learned from the Da Nang HMB have been shared to guide the development of HMB monitoring systems in other regions and countries. The digital monitoring system has proven to be a critical tool in maintaining the quality and safety of DHM, ultimately contributing to better health outcomes for children. The successful implementation of HMB services underscores the importance of robust monitoring systems in its operations and highlights the potential for digital solutions to enhance healthcare services.",

      "abstract": "The workspace in open-pit mining systems often suffers from insufficient or uneven illumination due to spatial constraints and obstructions caused by large equipment or geotechnical structures, leading to degraded surveillance imagery and consequently impacting safety monitoring efforts. This study designed an open-pit mine surveillance image enhancement model based on a parallel multi-scale feature fusion Transformer to address the degradation of surveillance video images and leverage the superior expressive power of Transformer networks in visual image processing compared to other networks. The network architecture mainly processes and integrates full-size feature maps and various levels of downsampled feature maps in parallel, preserving both the semantic relationships of image elements and their overall structure. The downsampling process of the network aims to maximize the extraction and restoration of the luminance features of small-sized objects from low-resolution images. By integrating features from downsampling, full-size image processing effectively restores illumination, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the images. To reduce the computational demands of the Transformer structure and facilitate its application in monitoring imagery, we employed an orthogonal self-attention mechanism along both the rows and columns of the image to be processed. This mechanism shifts the network's computational demand from exponential to linear growth. During the training phase, the network model was trained using a dataset collected on-site to enhance the model's adaptability to field conditions. SSIM and PSNR test results confirm that this model performs exceptionally well in open-pit mining production systems.",

      "abstract": "Background Symptom reduction in skin-picking disorder (SPD) has previously been demonstrated using deceptive placebo treatments. However, to date, no study has investigated the effects of open-label placebos (OLPs) in this context. Method Fifty-two participants (mean age = 30 years, 85% female) with pathological skin-picking took part in a clinical crossover trial. The study included daily app-assisted symptom monitoring over two conditions: two weeks of OLP treatment (one pill per day) and two weeks without OLP treatment. No pharmacological treatment was given to reduce skin-picking during the trial. Symptom severity was measured using a disorder-specific questionnaire administered at baseline and after each two-week condition (OLP, no OLP) along with daily app ratings of symptom severity. Results Both self-monitoring with and without OLP treatment resulted in reduced questionnaire scores compared to baseline. Daily app-based ratings showed a modest reduction (-3%) in the urge to engage in skin-picking and the time spent picking (-6 minutes/day) during the OLP condition. Participants generally adhered well to the pill-taking protocol, though many were skeptic toward the OLP treatment. Conclusion When used as a stand-alone-intervention, OLP treatment demonstrated only minimal effects beyond those achieved through self-monitoring.",

The widespread adoption of smartwatches offers a promising platform for continuous dietary monitoring in real-world scenarios. However, existing smartwatch-based approaches struggle with challenges in open-world scenarios, including dynamic interference, unrestricted eating gestures, and previously unseen daily behaviors. In this work, we present DietWatch, an open-world dietary monitoring system that utilizes a commercial smartwatch to capture fine-grained dietary behaviors. First, DietWatch mitigates acoustic and inertial interferences via Conv-TasNet and Bi-GRU. Then, DietWatch leverages a contrastive learning-based method to analyze human gestures, ensuring accurate eating gesture identification even in the presence of previously unseen daily gestures. Furthermore, a clustering algorithm is designed to estimate dietary time, while an attention-based multimodal fusion method is employed to classify food categories. Experimental evaluations in open-world settings demonstrate that DietWatch achieves 79.75% tIoU for eating time detection, 86.0% accuracy in food classification.",

      "abstract": "Objective Body scan meditation is a popular mindfulness practice in which a person directs their attention toward internal bodily sensations. Although its neural mechanisms have been investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging, few studies have used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to directly measure prefrontal networks during body scan meditation. Methods In this study, symptoms of depression and anxiety were measured in 40 healthy young adults without prior meditation experience. Participants\u2019 prefrontal networks were evaluated using fNIRS during body scan meditation and resting with nature sounds. Results Analyses of fNIRS data revealed significant positive prefrontal network connectivity in both conditions, with greater connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex observed when participants were resting with nature sounds than during body scan meditation. Correlation analyses showed that the left dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus\u2013right medial superior frontal gyrus connectivity during body scan meditation was negatively associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms and positively associated with emotion regulation abilities. Conclusion Enhanced prefrontal networks induced by meditation may have therapeutic implications for mental health. The fNIRS findings, which measured direct changes in prefrontal networks during body scan meditation, could serve as a cornerstone for understanding the neural correlates.",

      "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental condition, but current treatment options are limited. Although medication is widely used, it does not fully address all challenges and can result in considerable side effects. One approach showing promise in alleviating symptoms is mindfulness. However, typical mindfulness-based stress reduction programmes require a significant time commitment, resulting in high attrition. Researchers have therefore started to focus on discrete components on mindfulness, including the body scan meditation. Before embarking on large-scale trials, it is helpful to understand the willingness and preferences for body scan practice. Using an online survey, we examined current mindfulness exercises and preferences, willingness, belief that it was feasible to engage in body scan practices in 157 individuals with ADHD. We found that most were not currently practising mindfulness but were willing to do so and believed that it was feasible. Symptom severity and available space were predictors of willingness. Preferences were shown for professional classes and 1\u20132 body scan practices per week. These data indicate people with ADHD are willing to engage with body scan practices, supporting the implementation of large-scale studies. The result provides insights to support the co-development of an intervention based on body scan meditation to manage the difficulties and the design of future studies to investigate its efficacy.",

      "abstract": "Immersion as an umbrella experience and embodiment are regarded as primary advantages of virtual reality and its capability to lead to other reflective experiences. Beyond the basis of stereoscopic head-mounted displays, however, there is paucity of research on altered ways of experiencing virtual reality with regards to the possibilities afforded by this medium. To address this gap, we explore the effects of perspective shifts, both in terms of the visual and aural modalities, on embodiment and embodied mindfulness. Using a virtual reality application that administers a body-scan meditation using different visual- and aural perspectives, we investigate the effects these perspectives have on embodiment and embodied mindfulness. Our results indicate that a first-person visual perspective positively influenced a change in perceived body schema, but not in acceptance of virtual body ownership or control/agency of a virtual body, nor do they suggest an effect of audio-based perspective on these outcomes. Investigation into the moderating effects of mindfulness- and immersive tendencies on these factors suggest that participants with low immersive tendencies experienced a greater change in their body schema in the visual first-person condition compared to the third-person condition. A qualitative content analysis on participants\u2019 experiences indicate that few participants were able to express their experience in terms of audio. Our results contribute to the body of work on altered self-representations for mindfulness and extends on this concept with the notion of listening perspective as well as more generally to the design of sound, perspective, and embodiment in virtual reality.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: Mental health issues, particularly stress and depression, are highly prevalent among the elderly, especially those residing in old age homes. Elevated serum cortisol levels are associated with prolonged stress and depression, leading to further health complications. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based approach in reducing stress, depression, and serum cortisol levels among elderly individuals in institutional care. Materials and methodology: This quasi-experimental study was conducted in two old age homes in Chennai. A total of 48 elderly participants (aged 60\u201380 years) were selected using convenience sampling and divided into experimental (mindfulness intervention) and control (routine care) groups. The 12 weeks mindfulness intervention included techniques such as 5-Senses Grounding, Body Scan Meditation, mindfulness eating, Mindful Walking and breathing space meditation. Data were collected at baseline and 12 weeks post-intervention using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form (GDS-SF), and serum cortisol levels. Results: Post-intervention, 83.33% of the experimental group reported low stress compared to 12.50% in the control group (P = 0.001). Depression also significantly improved, with 41.67% achieving expected levels in the experimental group, while 70.83% in the control group remained moderately depressed (P = 0.001). However, serum cortisol levels showed no significant reduction (P = 0.21). Conclusion: Mindfulness-based interventions effectively reduced stress and depression but did not significantly impact serum cortisol levels. Future research should examine longer interventions and alternative biomarkers. Nurses are key in integrating mindfulness into elderly care to enhance mental well-being.",

We present MindfulBreath, an interactive system that uses real-time respiratory data to recommend a personalized breathing pace and visualize each inhale and exhale as flowing movement through a human figure. Designed as a preparatory experience, MindfulBreath helps users rehearse attentional control and embodied focus before beginning body scan meditation. In a study with 15 participants, Initial findings suggest that MindfulBreath may improve focus, relaxation, and engagement over passive music or standard breathing apps. These preliminary results indicate the potential visually embodied breathing exercises effectively bridge to deeper mindfulness. Unlike conventional mindfulness apps and devices, which offer fixed timing or generic animations, MindfulBreath adapts in real time to each user's unique respiratory pattern, positioning breath not only as a target of observation, but as an accessible medium for embodied mental training.",

      "abstract": "Academic burnout is one of the serious challenges faced by students as a result of high academic pressure, excessive workload, and complex social expectations. This study aims to explore the role of mindfulness in reducing academic burnout levels among students through a qualitative approach using a case study method. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with students who experienced burnout and applied mindfulness techniques in their academic lives. The findings reveal that mindfulness, through practices such as breathing meditation, body scan, mindful walking, and reflective journaling, is effective in reducing symptoms of emotional exhaustion, enhancing focus, and improving sleep quality and mental health. However, challenges such as time constraints, lack of consistency, and minimal environmental support hinder the implementation of these practices. Nevertheless, the participating students managed to overcome these obstacles by establishing regular practice schedules and forming support communities. This study concludes that mindfulness is an effective and adaptive strategy for managing academic burnout. Therefore, it is recommended that higher education institutions integrate mindfulness programs into counseling services, curricula, and student activities as both preventive and curative efforts to improve students\u2019 mental well-being and academic achievement.This research is expected to serve as a foundation for the development of broader, evidence-based psychological policies and interventions in university settings",

      "abstract": "Informal caregivers play a crucial supportive role throughout the course of illnesses, particularly in patients with cancer. Following a cancer diagnosis, informal caregivers often experience substantial psychological, physical, and social stress, which may lead to conditions such as anxiety and sleep disturbances. Therefore, implementing interventions aimed at reducing anxiety and improving sleep quality is essential. The present study aims to assess the impact of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) training on anxiety and sleep quality among informal caregivers of patients with cancer. This randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2024 on 66 informal caregivers of cancer patients in Bushehr, Iran. Participants were selected using convenience sampling method and then randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. The intervention group received eight sessions of MBSR training, each lasting 120 min, which included mindfulness meditation, body scan, and mindful breathing exercises. The control group received no intervention. Data were collected using a demographic form, Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Data were analyzed using SPSS 26.0 through descriptive statistics, independent t-test, paired t-test, and ANCOVA at a significance level of 0.05. The results indicated a statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding both anxiety and sleep quality after the intervention (anxiety: P\u2009<\u20090.001, \u03b7p\u00b2 = 0.22; sleep quality: P\u2009=\u20090.004, \u03b7p\u00b2 = 0.12). In the intervention group, the mean anxiety score decreased from 105.94\u2009\u00b1\u200911.73 (pretest) to 80.39\u2009\u00b1\u200913.68 (one-month follow-up), and the mean sleep quality score (PSQI) improved from 11.26\u2009\u00b1\u20092.65 to 9.94\u2009\u00b1\u20092.09. In contrast, the control group showed no significant improvement. The results of this study suggest that mindfulness-based interventions may help reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality in female informal caregivers of cancer patients. This intervention shows promise as a potentially effective approach for promoting caregivers\u2019 mental health. However, the findings are only applicable to women and cannot be generalized to male caregivers, who may experience different social and emotional burdens. In addition, the use of a passive control group and the dual role of the instructor (intervention delivery and homework monitoring) represent important limitations. Furthermore, due to the small sample size, use of convenience sampling, and partial blinding, the results should be interpreted with caution. Future research should include both genders, use active control conditions, and conduct larger long-term randomized trials to confirm these outcomes and assess their generalizability across different settings.

      "abstract": "Academic stress has become a significant challenge for students across all educational levels, often resulting in anxiety, burnout, reduced motivation, and impaired cognitive performance. The pressure to meet academic expectations, manage heavy workloads, and sustain high performance underscores the urgent need for effective stress-reduction strategies in education. Mindfulness\u2014defined as purposeful, present-moment awareness without judgment\u2014has been recognized as a promising approach for enhancing emotional regulation, reducing stress, and promoting overall well-being.\n\nThis study examined the impact of mindfulness practices on reducing academic stress among 200 students aged 16\u201322, randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The experimental group underwent an eight-week structured mindfulness program, including guided meditation, mindful breathing, reflective journaling, and body scan techniques. Standardized instruments, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), were administered pre- and post-intervention.\n\nResults demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in perceived stress among students who received mindfulness training compared to controls. Gender-based differences emerged, with female students showing higher mindfulness scores and slightly lower stress levels. Participants also reported improved concentration, time management, sleep quality, and a more balanced approach to academic challenges. These findings support the integration of mindfulness programs into academic institutions as a sustainable, evidence-based strategy to enhance student mental health and performance.",

      "abstract": "Individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) frequently encounter complex physical, emotional and social challenges that substantially diminish their Quality of Life (QoL). Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) has increasingly been recognized as a supportive, non-pharmacological strategy for enhancing well-being in populations with chronic illness. This pilot investigation examined the potential influence of an MBSR program on QoL outcomes among patients undergoing hemodialysis. A quasi-experimental pretest\u2013posttest framework was applied with ten participants recruited from a dialysis unit. The intervention cohort engaged in an eight-week structured MBSR program involving weekly one-hour sessions incorporating focused breathing, mindfulness meditation and body-scan practices, while the control cohort continued with standard clinical care. QoL was assessed before and after the intervention using the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form (KDQOL-SF v1.3). Analytical procedures included paired and independent t-tests, in addition to correlational analyses exploring associations with demographic and treatment-related parameters. Notable improvements were observed in the intervention group across multiple domains Symptoms and Problems (p = 0.0018), Effects of Kidney Disease (p = 0.0284), Sleep (p = 0.0468), Physical Functioning (p = 0.0265) and Role Limitations due to Physical Health (p = 0.0211). Post-intervention patterns indicated that demographic attributes and dialysis-related variables influenced specific QoL dimensions. These preliminary findings suggest that MBSR may offer meaningful benefits for both physical and psychological dimensions of QoL among hemodialysis patients and merits further evaluation in larger controlled studies.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This randomized controlled trial explored the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of integrating mindfulness-based body scan (MBBS) interventions into multimodal pelvic floor physiotherapy for vulvodynia treatment. Participants received ten sessions of standardized physiotherapy. The mindfulness intervention group was instructed to additionally perform home-based audio-file guided MBBS five times a week. The primary study endpoint was feasibility. The effect on pain intensity, pain characteristics and sexuality were assessed with Numeric Rating scales (NRS), the McGill-Melzack Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), the Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS) and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and digital assessment of pelvic floor. Thirty-three women were randomized and completed the end-of-treatment assessments and 26 (79%) attended the follow-up. 15 of 17 participants of the intervention group (88%) performed the body scans more than ten times and the feasibility criteria were achieved. The intervention group showed significantly better improvements in NRS of average pain, MPQ subscales and FSDS total score. Pelvic floor assessment showed a significant improvement of myofascial pressure points over time with no difference between study groups. Integration of MBBS trainings into multimodal pelvic floor physiotherapy for vulvodynia is feasible and well accepted and may improve pain reduction and sexual function.",

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: This study reports an association between nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) and perinasal uptake on radioactive iodine (RAI) whole-body scan. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study of 37 patients from May to November 2017 who underwent thyroidectomy and I-131 ablation for papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and had a follow-up I-123 diagnostic WBS and dacryoscintigraphy. Ophthalmic examinations assessed punctal stenosis, NLDO, tear film break-up time, Schirmer\u2019s test, punctate keratopathy, tear meniscus height, epiphora, and ocular dryness. Perinasal and nasal uptake on whole-body scans (WBSs) were assessed as negative (no uptake) or positive (focal uptake). The associations between perinasal uptake on WBS, dacryoscintigraphy findings, and ophthalmic assessments were assessed. Results: Nasal uptake on I-131 post-ablation WBS were observed in 60 eyes (81%); perinasal uptake was observed in 8 eyes (11%). Nasal uptake on I-123 post-ablation WBS were observed in all eyes; perinasal uptake was observed in 15 eyes (20%). Perinasal and nasal uptake on I-131 post-ablation WBS were significantly associated with delayed excretion on dacryoscintigraphy (p < 0.001 and p = 0.03, respectively). Perinasal uptake on I-123 WBS was associated with both abnormal dacryoscintigraphy findings and ocular dryness (p < 0.001 and p = 0.02, respectively). Conclusions: Perinasal uptake on I-131 post-ablation and I-123 diagnostic WBS was significantly associated with delayed excretion on dacryoscintigraphy, suggesting NLDO.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Mindfulness practices, such as the body scan, could enhance interoception. While prior research shows promise for its effects on interoceptive sensibility (IS; subjective experience of bodily cues) and accuracy (IAcc; accurate detection of bodily signals), studies often use a limited set of interoceptive variables or apply small samples. In two pre\u2010registered randomized trials, we examined a 2\u2010week daily auditory body scan intervention vs. active control (guided imagery; Study 1) or passive control (Study 2). Study 1 included N\u2009=\u200985 participants (M age\u2009=\u200922.26, 71% women), randomized to body scan or guided imagery. Study 2 included N\u2009=\u200990 participants (M age\u2009=\u200923.05, 80% women), randomized to body scan or passive control. IAcc was measured pre\u2010 and post\u2010intervention using the heartbeat tracking task (HTT) and heartbeat discrimination task (HDT), while IS was assessed via confidence ratings and the multidimensional assessment of interoceptive awareness (MAIA\u20102). Study 1 showed significant time effects for IAcc (HTT: p\u2009<\u2009.001; HDT: p\u2009=\u2009.012), confidence ratings (p's\u2009<\u2009.001), and MAIA\u20102 (p\u2009<\u2009.001). Study 2 found improvements following the body scan for IAcc (HTT: p\u2009=\u2009.050), confidence ratings (HTT: p\u2009=\u2009.006; HDT: p\u2009=\u2009.0496), and MAIA\u20102 (p\u2009=\u2009.003). Findings suggest that body scan enhances interoception within two weeks, though guided imagery and similar approaches may yield comparable effects.",

Methods: This retrospective study included 148 intermediate-risk PTC patients who underwent high-dose RAI therapy after total thyroidectomy. PAWBS was performed 7 days post-therapy, and thyroid bed uptake was visually graded. Treatment response was assessed using stimulated thyroglobulin (sTg) levels, imaging studies, and clinical follow-up. Responses were classified into excellent, indeterminate, biochemical incomplete, or structural incomplete categories. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of treatment response. Results: Among the 148 patients, 126 (85.1%) achieved an excellent response (ER), while 22 (14.9%) showed a non-excellent response (NER), which included indeterminate, biochemical incomplete, and structural incomplete responses. Patients with NER exhibited significantly higher thyroid bed uptake on PAWBS compared to ER patients (p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that higher thyroid bed uptake was an independent negative prognostic factor for achieving an excellent response (p < 0.001), along with sTg (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The intensity of thyroid bed uptake on PAWBS independently predicts treatment response in intermediate-risk PTC patients receiving high-dose RAI therapy, with higher uptake indicating a worse prognosis.",

      "abstract": "3D body scanning technology is becoming increasingly popular in the apparel and health industries due to its accessibility, affordability, and precision. 3D images offer biometrically accurate images for estimating body shape and size, which may align mental constructs of the body with an objective body assessment, which would be helpful in illustrating the effects of treatments or interventions for lifestyle\u2010related diseases and body image disorders by demonstrating physical changes to the body. This five\u2010phase one\u2010group exploratory study examined affective responses to obtaining a full\u2010body 3D scan. In a sample of 45, we used summative content analysis and inductive content analysis to examine two open\u2010ended questions about the body scan experience, body visualization, and affect. The study found that participants generally reacted positively to the scanning experience, but some reported negative affective responses, such as self\u2010consciousness. Some participants experienced stress and decreased body satisfaction due to the detailed and realistic nature of the scans highlighting perceived imperfections. The study found few gender differences in responses, with men showing slightly more positive reactions. This aligns with patterns of body surveillance and psychological distress being more pervasive in women. Both men and women are affected by cultural pressures related to body image, leading to self\u2010objectification and psychological distress, which highlights the need for ethical use of the technology to minimize potential harm.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: Radiomics has been principally applied for characterization of tumor heterogeneity which by virtue of its predictive power in the prognostication, claims further implication in the management. As a practitioner of radioactive iodine therapy, we have observed the characteristic of radiomic features extracted from post radioiodine therapy whole body scan. Patients and methods: Anterior planar images from 39 patients who underwent radioiodine therapy after thyroidectomy due to differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma were analyzed in LIFEX software to generate radiomic feature (RF) data from two regions of interest (ROI): neck and liver per patient. Correlation of the RF was checked against two demographic variables, patient\u2019s body weight and patient\u2019s age and three clinical variables, administered radioiodine dose during therapy, pre therapy TSH level, pre therapy thyroglobulin level. After discovering features with significant correlation with demographic and clinical variables, the RF that correlated in each of the two ROI were shortlisted. Results: A total of 141 RF per ROI per patient were extracted using LIFEX while 32 Radiomics features from neck ROI and 15 radiomic features from liver ROI were discovered to have significant correlation with two demographic variables and three clinical variables (R ranged from -0.5 to 0.49, p < 0.05). Four radiomic features were common for both neck and liver ROI that have significant correlations. Among those four, one was correlated with body weight and three were with therapy dose. Pre therapy TSH level was found to have correlation with 10 features from neck ROI and no feature from liver ROI. Pre therapy Tg level was found to have correlation with two features from neck ROI and one feature from liver ROI. Conclusions: With further exploration, the RF from post radioiodine therapy whole body scan may evolve as a useful aid to the management of differentiated thyroid cancer by providing prediction about clinical outcome as well as by playing as surrogates of histopathological and immunohistochemical markers.\nBangladesh J.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nDifferentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) frequently metastasizes to lymph nodes, significantly influencing patient prognosis. Posttherapy I-131 whole-body scan with SPECT/computed tomography (CT) (Rx-WBS) is crucial in detecting residual metastatic lymph nodes (reLNs). This study aimed to construct spatial heatmaps of reLNs based on the Rx-WBS to visualize anatomical distribution and to provide references for optimizing lymph node dissection (LND) strategies.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis retrospective study included 110 intermediate- to high-risk DTC patients who underwent thyroidectomy and LND, followed by I-131 therapy within 3 months postoperatively. reLNs were manually identified and segmented on Rx-WBS using ITK-SNAP. All reLNs were registered onto a reference patient's CT image based on anatomical landmarks. Representative axial and sagittal heatmaps were generated to illustrate the reLNs' spatial patterns. Univariate analysis and multivariable negative binomial regression were used to identify the factors associated with reLNs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 276 reLNs from 110 patients were mapped to the reference CT. Heatmaps demonstrated that reLNs were most concentrated in level \u2165 (39.5%), followed by levels \u2163 (19.2%) and \u2162 (17.0%), clustering around the internal carotid artery and jugular vein. Levels I, \u2164, and the retropharyngeal space showed lower involvement. Univariate analysis revealed that age and the extent of LND were potential influencing factors.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study constructed anatomical heatmaps of reLNs, revealing spatial 'hotspots' of residual metastases. These visualizations illustrate the anatomical distribution of reLNs and may assist in refining LND strategies.",

      "abstract": "Background Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is prevalent and a multimodal therapy is indicated, including psychological treatment. Effective conventional treatments involve psychoeducation and mindfulness-based body scans, while virtual reality offers superior but temporary pain relief. Augmented Reality (AR), which combines conventional and virtual methods, is a novel therapeutic strategy. Methods We investigated the viability and acceptability of an AR intervention for CLBP by incorporating psychoeducation and mindfulness-based body scan techniques. 40 participants in two studies with a one-arm design underwent an educational AR intervention (Study I, n1\u2009=\u200918) and an enhanced version with an additional body scan (Study II, n2\u2009=\u200922). The studies focused on evaluating technical feasibility and multiple facets of user experience. Results The results demonstrated high feasibility with low dropout rates (Study I: 10%, Study II: 0%). User experience ratings ranged from \u201cAbove Average\u201d to \u201cExcellent,\u201d with the advanced intervention receiving higher ratings. While Study I showed no significant changes in affect pre- vs. post-intervention, Study II exhibited a significant reduction in negative affect and improved valence. Qualitative analysis provided insights into technical requirements and user perceptions. Discussion The AR prototype emerges as a promising psychoeducational tool for CLBP, aligning with current treatment guidelines and providing a basis for future controlled clinical trials. Limitations include the absence of a high-pain intervention group, as Study I reported a pain intensity of M\u2009=\u20091.05 and Study II reported M\u2009=\u20091.77 (Range: 0\u201310). Further research such as clinical trials with control groups is required to validate the efficacy of the piloted approach. The AR-based psychoeducation and mindfulness body scan intervention for CLBP demonstrated technical feasibility and a good user experience.

A diverse spectrum of uptake patterns, encompassing both physiological and pathological entities, has been reported in patients undergoing RAI studies. Particularly, a variety of non-thyroidal conditions can present with unusual patterns of RAI uptake in the liver, complicating diagnosis. This case report presents a 51-year-old female with papillary thyroid cancer who underwent a whole-body RAI scan. The study revealed an atypical pattern of increased radiotracer concentration within the liver for which subsequent radiological investigations led to the diagnosis of two liver lesions, one was a simple hepatic cyst and another was most likely to be a hepatic arteriovenous malformation (HAVM) both located in segment VII based on abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, an unexpected finding that could be mistaken for other differential diagnoses, including metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), granulomas, abscesses, hydatid cysts, biliary tract dilatation, and other benign non-thyroidal neoplasia. Recognizing these diverse entities is essential for the accurate interpretation of RAI scans and for avoiding misdiagnosis. This finding may help clinicians avoid misdiagnosing such ancillary observations as metastases, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy in thyroid cancer management.",

Additionally, the study evaluated the reliability of the asymmetry thresholds suggested in the Joseph\u2013Armstrong patternmaking method. By exploring these factors, the research aimed to provide valuable insights for improving garment fit and patternmaking practices to better accommodate diverse body shapes and characteristics.\n \n \n \n The Size USA database was used to analyze bilateral body asymmetries among women's body measurements and the associations among body measurements with age, race and BMI in patternmaking and clothing fit.\n \n \n \n This study validated the need for drafting an asymmetric pattern when the difference between the left and right sides of the body at the shoulder slope exceeds 1/8 inch. Additionally, how body asymmetry should be accommodated when drafting flat patterns was examined using a bodice example. The asymmetrical garment, drafted based on the shorter shoulder slope measurements, provided the best fit.\n \n \n \n Patternmakers develop patterns based on the right side of the body, assuming the other side would have exact mirror symmetry. However, the human body is not perfectly symmetrical. Even though there are recommendations that patterns should be altered to improve the fit if body measurements vary considerably between the left and right sides, only a few guidelines exist about asymmetrical variations. Study findings implied that when significant differences in body measurements, such as shoulder slope, are present, asymmetries should be accounted for in patternmaking to ensure better fit.\n",

      "abstract": "Accurately assessing the risk of cesarean section (CS) delivery is critical, especially in settings with limited medical resources, where access to healthcare is often restricted. Early and reliable risk prediction allows better-informed prenatal care decisions and can improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, most existing predictive models are tailored for in-hospital use during labor and rely on parameters that are often unavailable in resource-limited or home-based settings. In this study, we conduct a pilot investigation to examine the feasibility of using 3D body shape for CS risk assessment for future applications with more affordable general devices. We propose a novel multi-view-based Transformer network, MvBody, which predicts CS risk using only self-reported medical data and 3D optical body scans obtained between the 31st and 38th weeks of gestation. To enhance training efficiency and model generalizability in data-scarce environments, we incorporate a metric learning loss into the network. Compared to widely used machine learning models and the latest advanced 3D analysis methods, our method demonstrates superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 84.62% and an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.724 on the independent test set. To improve transparency and trust in the model's predictions, we apply the Integrated Gradients algorithm to provide theoretically grounded explanations of the model's decision-making process. Our results indicate that pre-pregnancy weight, maternal age, obstetric history, previous CS history, and body shape, particularly around the head and shoulders, are key contributors to CS risk prediction.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Smoking is a major public health concern worldwide. However, smoking cessation significantly reduces the negative outcomes associated with tobacco use. Therefore, smoking cessation treatments play a crucial role in public health. The two primary approaches to smoking cessation are psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. In this study, we aim to share our experience with cytisine-based smoking cessation treatment in our outpatient clinic, which has recently been introduced in our country. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study conducted on individuals presenting to the Smoking Cessation Outpatient Clinic of Bal\u0131kesir Atat\u00fcrk City Hospital between June 1, 2024, and December 31, 2024. Patients received cytisine treatment for one month, and their demographic data, smoking cessation status, and any reported side effects were recorded. Results: A total of 754 patients presented to the Smoking Cessation Outpatient Clinic during the study period. After applying the exclusion criteria, the final study population included 557 patients. The smoking cessation rate among participants was 55.3% (n=308). Additionally, 124 out of 557 patients (22.3%) reported experiencing at least one side effect, with a total of 158 side effects recorded. Smoking cessation success was higher among patients who did not experience side effects. Discussion and Conclusion: For a drug to be deemed appropriate for clinical use, it must be both effective and have minimal side effects. Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of cytisine, and its side-effect profile has been well documented in the literature. Our findings indicate that data from our country are generally consistent with existing literature. In our study, the most commonly reported side effects were nausea, dry mouth, and insomnia. We shared our experience with the use of cytisine, which has been recently introduced in our country. Our findings indicate that cytisine is effective in smoking cessation and is associated with mild, tolerable side effects.",

      "abstract": "Objectives This study analyzed the factors influencing smoking cessation attempts among smoking adolescents in South Korea, focusing on gender differences, using data from the 20th Korea Youth Risk Behavior Survey. \nMethods A total of 2,419 smoking adolescents who met the study criteria were analyzed. Differences in general characteristics, smoking-related characteristics, and mental health characteristics based on smoking cessation attempts were examined using complex sample descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and linear regression analyses. Additionally, complex sample logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors influencing smoking cessation attempts. \nResults Among the smoking adolescents, 65.8% had attempted to quit smoking, while 34.2% had not. For male adolescents, significant factors influencing smoking cessation attempts included age (p < .001), smoking type (p < .001), friends' smoking status (p = .005), and experience with smoking cessation education (p < .001). For female adolescents, significant factors were friends' smoking status (p = .006) and smoking cessation education experience (p < .001). \nConclusions This study highlights the need for gender-specific interventions in smoking cessation programs for adolescents. These programs should go beyond simple prevention education and consider the factors influencing smoking cessation decisions in both boys and girls. A multifaceted approach can help foster healthy lifestyles and reduce smoking rates among adolescents.",

      "abstract": "\n \n \n Smoking is a key contributor to cancer disparities, particularly among adults with low socioeconomic status (SES), who smoke at nearly twice the national rate (24% vs. 15%) and experience elevated cancer morbidity and mortality. Community health workers (CHWs), as trusted frontline public health professionals embedded in underserved communities, are uniquely positioned to address tobacco use outside of traditional healthcare settings. Prior research has shown that training CHWs in brief tobacco interventions requires adaptation to their relational and community-based roles. However, little is known about which CHWs benefit most from cessation training\u2014an equity gap that may hinder effective implementation and workforce development.\n \n \n \n To identify sociodemographic factors associated with improvement in tobacco-related knowledge and confidence in delivering cessation support among CHWs following a modified smoking cessation training.\n \n \n \n We conducted a secondary analysis of pre- and post-training data from 155 CHWs in Chicago, IL, recruited from a public health department, community-based organizations, and a CHW degree program. CHWs completed pre-tests prior to training and post-tests at its conclusion. Outcomes were the changes in tobacco-related knowledge and confidence scores from pre- to post- training. Independent variables were age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, prior tobacco training, and time in position. Multivariable linear regression was used to identify predictors of change.\n \n \n \n We found that 155 CHWs completed the pre-training test, and 144 completed the post-training test. Post-training scores for tobacco-related knowledge and confidence were significantly higher than pre-training scores (p < 0.001). Greater increases in readiness to deliver cessation support were observed among CHWs with postgraduate education (p = 0.049), while older CHWs showed smaller improvements (p = 0.043). Black or African American CHWs also showed smaller improvements in confidence (p = 0.039). No consistent predictors were found for changes in knowledge, motivation, confidence, or MI-specific confidence.\n \n \n \n These findings highlight the effectiveness of the training, as it led to significant improvements in both tobacco-related knowledge and confidence among CHWs. The lack of consistent predictors suggests that the training is broadly applicable and equitable across diverse CHW populations. However, the smaller confidence gains among African American and older CHWs point to the need for future training to incorporate culturally responsive and age-sensitive approaches to ensure that all CHWs benefit fully. Addressing these disparities in training outcomes is critical for reducing broader health disparities, as CHWs play a key role in delivering cessation support in underserved communities. Tailoring training to meet the needs of diverse CHWs can strengthen their ability to promote equitable tobacco cessation outcomes and advance health equity.\n \n \n \n Andres Mauricio Garcia Sierra, Victoria Nassar Abuabara, Marcia Tan.

      "abstract": "This article aims to explore the optimization of mental performance through the analysis of metrics associated with the psychological state known as flow. Several clinical studies have shown a correlation between the mental state of flow (characterized by deep and relaxed concentration and high psychophysical efficiency) and brain activity measured through electroencephalography (EEG). This study confirms such a correlation, focusing in particular on the sports field, where the flow state tends to occur more frequently. To conduct the study, Sporthype developed proprietary software that integrates several predictive models, in particular the Flow State Index (FSI), implemented within the Holytics system. An analytical protocol was established, including mental exercises and data collection sessions using the portable EEG device Muse, accompanied by a questionnaire to gather athletes'subjective perceptions of their mental state. The results revealed a significant alignment between the EEG data and the subjective experiences reported in the questionnaires, confirming the feasibility of detecting the flow state through prefrontal cortex activity. Furthermore, the psychological exercises included in the study protocol showed a tangible positive effect in enhancing flow during athletic performance. Flow improves performance through a more harmonious synchronization between mind and body. Although golf was the main context of the experimentation, the mathematical models developed within Holytics were designed to be applicable to a wide range of sports. In addition to golf, preliminary tests have been conducted in other sports such as tennis, as well as in non-sport contexts, including gaming and mental training practices such as mindfulness, concentration, and visualization.",

Autonomic nervous system activity indices were continuously monitored. The results indicate that the U-K test, which is a low-difficulty, monotonous task, failed to induce a flow state. Physiological responses to mental tasks showed an increased heart rate, suggesting a Pattern 1 response. The participants who entered a flow state, based on their flow and time perception scores, had a decreased heart rate immediately after the task, supporting the association between the flow state and Pattern 2 responses. Considering the relationship between flow and Pattern 2 responses, it is recommended to assess flow using multiple physiological markers, including blood pressure.",

      "abstract": "The magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow state in multiple electrically coupled ducts for liquid metal blankets is investigated to accurately predict the effect of duct quantity on pressure distribution, with further consideration of duct aspect ratio and arrangement. We conducted three-dimensional numerical simulations to analyze 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009n and m\u2009\u00d7\u2009n matrix of duct systems in both co-flow and counter-flow configurations. For 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009n duct systems, the pressure drop (\u0394p) can be reduced to 60% of that observed in a single duct when n\u2009=\u200910 under co-flow configurations. We further propose a mathematical model that accurately predicts the pressure gradient as a function of n for co-flow systems. In counter-flow cases, \u0394pmax decreases with increasing odd n greater than 2, whereas an opposite trend is observed when n is even for b/a\u2009\u2264\u20091. When b/a\u2009>\u20091, the coupling pressure drops increase with n. \u0394pmax reaches over 60 times that of a single duct among all cases in this study. In order to mitigate excessive MHD coupling pressure drop in counter-flow configurations, we design a new structure with different slot layouts on each coupling Hartmann wall, which is effective in reducing the pressure drop within multi-coupled ducts. We analyze the results of m\u2009\u00d7\u2009n matrix duct systems, indicating that placing the inlet on opposite sides can prevent an increase in pressure drop caused by adding n perpendicular to the magnetic field in counter-flow configurations when n is even. These findings will provide valuable physical insights for the application of multi-coupled ducts in liquid blanket systems.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Meditation training in older adults has been proposed as a non-pharmacological intervention to promote healthy aging and lower the risks of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Resting-state dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) highlighted two brain states, the \u201cstrongly connected\u201d and \u201cdefault mode network (DMN)-negatively connected\u201d states, associated with protective factors for dementia including AD, and two states, the \u201cweakly connected\u201d and \u201csalience-negatively connected\u201d states, associated with risk factors for dementia. In this study, we aimed at assessing the impact of an 18-month meditation training on dFNC states in older adults. One hundred and thirty-five healthy older adults were randomized (1:1:1) to 18-month meditation training, 18-month non-native language training, or no intervention. dFNC of the DMN, salience, and executive control networks was assessed in 124 individuals using a sliding window framework, and states were obtained by k-means clustering. Linear mixed models evaluated the change in time spent in different connectivity \u201cstates\u201d and the number of transitions between states for each group and between groups. Only participants in the meditation group transitioned significantly more between states (p = 0.008, d = 0.52), with a significant between-group difference with the non-native language training group (p = 0.001). Moreover, only the meditation group showed a change in time spent in specific states, spending less time in the \u201cweakly connected\u201d state (p = 0.009, d = -0.44) and more time in the \u201cstrongly connected\u201d state (p = 0.03, d = 0.46), but there was no difference between groups. Brain states at rest were significantly impacted by an 18-month meditation intervention, with increased number of transitions between states, an increased time spent in the \u201cstrongly connected\u201d state, and decreased time spent in the \u201cweakly connected\u201d state. While only the first change differed significantly between groups, these results suggest a beneficial effect of meditation through a reduction in dFNC metrics associated with AD risk factors and an increase in dFNC metrics associated with protective factors. However, the absence of a significant group-by-time interaction for time spent in states, the small effect sizes, and the fact that the sample size was not powered for this outcome limit the interpretation of the findings. Additionally, unmeasured factors such as genetic predisposition and lifestyle could have influenced the results. Future studies should identify the specific active mechanisms of meditation underlying these effects to optimize interventions.

      "abstract": "Hatha yoga, Qigong, Tai Chi, all ancient practices of the mind, continue to be studied and recognized for their mental and spiritual benefits. However, Tummo meditation and Niguma yoga, ancient practices with origins in the 8th and 11th centuries from the Himalayan Vajrayana tradition, remain obscure and have yet to be disseminated and studied. Previously only practiced by Vajrayana monks during a 3-year retreat, practitioners of Tummo and Niguma often report increased mindfulness and emotional calm following the exercises. In an effort to explore these once secret practices, the Manakai O M\u0101lama Integrative Healthcare Group investigated changes in brain activity prior to and following Tummo combined with Niguma in a seasoned Vajrayana practitioner. Using quantitative electroencephalogram imaging and spectral analysis, an increase in alpha band power and intra-connectivity was observed immediately post-practice, suggesting increased activation of the default mode network (DMN), a brain network directly involved in internalized cognition, self-reflection, emotional regulation, and creativity. These findings not only offer a scientific basis for further research, but also provide neurological evidence for the mental and cognitive benefits of Tummo meditation and Niguma yoga. With continued study, it is possible to validate ancient practices of Tummo and Niguma as effective health interventions. Moreover, this study furthers research showing how yoga and meditation techniques may be of benefit for behavioral health. In particular, cultural healing components of yoga and meditation may be more easily deployed in minority populations like Native Hawaiians, who are disproportionately at risk for mental health issues in Hawai'i.",

      "abstract": "Trait mindfulness refers to one's disposition or tendency to pay attention to their experiences in the present moment, in a non\u2010judgmental and accepting way. Trait mindfulness has been robustly associated with positive mental health outcomes, but its neural underpinnings are poorly understood. Prior resting\u2010state fMRI studies have associated trait mindfulness with within\u2010 and between\u2010network connectivity of the default\u2010mode (DMN), fronto\u2010parietal (FPN), and salience networks. However, it is unclear how generalizable the findings are, how they relate to different components of trait mindfulness, and how other networks and brain areas may be involved. To address these gaps, we conducted the largest resting\u2010state fMRI study of trait mindfulness to\u2010date, consisting of a pre\u2010registered connectome\u2010based predictive modeling analysis in 367 meditation\u2010na\u00efve adults across three samples collected at different sites. In the model\u2010training dataset, we did not find connections that predicted overall trait mindfulness, but we identified neural models of two mindfulness subscales, Acting with Awareness and Non\u2010judging. Models included both positive networks (sets of pairwise connections that positively predicted mindfulness with increasing connectivity) and negative networks, which showed the inverse relationship. The Acting with Awareness and Non\u2010judging positive network models showed distinct network representations involving FPN and DMN, respectively. The negative network models, which overlapped significantly across subscales, involved connections across the whole brain with prominent involvement of somatomotor, visual and DMN networks. Only the negative networks generalized to predict subscale scores out\u2010of\u2010sample, and not across both test datasets. Predictions from both models were also negatively correlated with predictions from a well\u2010established mind\u2010wandering connectome model. We present preliminary neural evidence for a generalizable connectivity models of trait mindfulness based on specific affective and cognitive facets. However, the incomplete generalization of the models across all sites and scanners, limited stability of the models, as well as the substantial overlap between the models, underscores the difficulty of finding robust brain markers of mindfulness facets.",

Here, we leverage postmortem histology and in vivo neuroimaging to characterize the anatomy of the DMN to better understand its role in information processing and cortical communication. Our results show that the DMN is cytoarchitecturally heterogenous, containing cytoarchitectural types that are variably specialized for unimodal, heteromodal and memory-related processing. Studying diffusion-based structural connectivity in combination with cytoarchitecture, we found the DMN contains regions receptive to input from sensory cortex and a core that is relatively insulated from environmental input. Finally, analysis of signal flow with effective connectivity models showed that the DMN is unique amongst cortical networks in balancing its output across the levels of sensory hierarchies. Together, our study establishes an anatomical foundation from which accounts of the broad role the DMN plays in human brain function and cognition can be developed.

      "abstract": "Simple Summary The Default Mode Network (DMN) is a brain network that becomes active when the brain is at rest. It is crucial for processes like self-reflection, emotional processing, social interaction, and mental exploration. Research has shown that the DMN is not exclusive to humans but is also found in non-human animals, suggesting its evolutionary importance across species. The DMN plays a significant role in brain development, especially during childhood and adolescence, where it shapes cognitive and emotional abilities. This review explores the structural, functional, and evolutionary aspects of the DMN and its impact from early development through adulthood. Understanding how the DMN operates can deepen our knowledge of how the brain supports thinking, behavior, and mental health. This knowledge can, in turn, lead to more effective treatments for various neuropsychiatric conditions. By studying the DMN, we gain insights into the neural mechanisms behind cognition and behavior, which could help develop better therapeutic strategies for mental health disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Social comparisons are a core feature of human life. Theories posit that social comparisons play a critical role in depression and social anxiety triggering negative evaluations about the self, as well as negative emotions. We investigated the neural basis of social comparisons in participants with major depression and/or social anxiety (MD-SA, n\u2009=\u200956) and healthy controls (n\u2009=\u200947) using functional magnetic resonance imaging. While being scanned participants performed a social comparison task, during which they received feedback about their performance and the performance of a coplayer. Upward social comparisons (being worse than the coplayer) elicited high levels of negative emotions (shame, guilt, and nervousness) across participants, with this effect being enhanced in the MD-SA group. Notably, during upward comparison the MD-SA group showed greater activation than the control group in regions of the default mode network (DMN). Specifically, for upward comparison MD-SA participants demonstrated increased activation in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and reduced deactivation in the posteromedial cortex, regions linked to self-referential processing, inferences about other people\u2019s thoughts, and rumination. Findings suggest that people with depression and social anxiety react to upward comparisons with a more negative emotional response, which may be linked to introspective processes related to the DMN.",

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly heterogeneous psychiatric disorder characterized with considerable individual variability in clinical manifestations which may correspond to brain alterations including the default mode network (DMN). This study analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data from 796 MDD patients and 823 healthy controls (HC) to investigate individual variability in functional connectivity (IVFC) between the DMN and 108 non-DMN regions. We aimed to identify MDD-related IVFC abnormalities and their clinical relevance, alongside exploring gene expression correlations. The results revealed similar spatial patterns of IVFC within the DMN in both groups, yet significantly increased IVFC values in MDD patients were observed in regions such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, fusiform gyrus, and occipital cortex. Notably, the mean IVFC in the DMN and fusiform gyrus was positively correlated with Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) scores in MDD patients. Gene expression analyses explained 47.0% of the variance in MDD-related IVFC alterations, with the most associated genes enriched in processes including membrane potential regulation, head development, synaptic transmission, and dopaminergic synapse. These findings highlight the clinical importance of IVFC variability in the DMN and suggest its potential role as a biomarker in MDD.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Neurologic impairment is common in patients with acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. While patients with severe COVID have a higher prevalence of neurologic symptoms, as many as one in five patients with mild COVID may also be affected, exhibiting impaired memory as well as other cognitive dysfunctions. Methods To characterize the effect of COVID on the brain, the current study recruited a group of adults with post-COVID cognitive complaints but with mild, non-hospitalized cases. They were then evaluated through formal neuropsychological testing and underwent functional MRI of the brain. The participants in our study performed nearly as expected for cognitively intact individuals. Additionally, we characterized the functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN), which is known for cognitive functions including memory as well as the attention functions involved in normal aging and degenerative diseases. Results Along with the retention of functional connectivity in the DMN, our results found the DMN to be associated with neurocognitive performance through region-of-interest and whole-brain analyses. The connectivity between key nodes of the DMN was positively correlated with cognitive scores (r\u202f=\u202f0.51, p\u202f=\u202f0.02), with higher performers exhibiting higher DMN connectivity. Discussion Our findings provide neuroimaging evidence of the functional connectivity of brain networks among individuals experiencing cognitive deficits beyond the recovery of mild COVID. These imaging outcomes indicate expected functional trends in the brain, furthering understanding and guidance of the DMN and neurocognitive deficits in patients recovering from COVID.",

Prior research has generally found less DMN synchrony during use and greater synchrony during cessation, although little research has utilized this method with opioid use. This study examined resting brain activity in treatment\u2010seeking persons who use opioids at two points\u2014when using opioids and when opioid\u2010free\u2014to determine whether the DMN exhibits different levels of connectivity during opioid use and cessation and whether differences in connectivity predict subsequent relapse. The sample included 11 participants who met DSM\u20105 criteria for opioid use disorder and initiated buprenorphine treatment following fMRI scans that were approximately 3\u2009days apart. Results showed greater functional connectivity in the DMN and the rIFG of the salience network (SN) when participants were abstaining than when actively using opioids. These changes in connectivity predicted 76.2% of the variance in withdrawal symptom severity, with the DMN nodes accounting for an additional 30.9%. Findings warrant further longitudinal exploration of the role of DMN connectivity and its interactions with other networks in relation to abstinence and withdrawal status and examination of its utility as a prognostic marker of cessation or relapse.",

      "abstract": "An often-desired feature of motor learning is that it generalizes to untrained scenarios. Yet, how this is supported by brain activity remains poorly understood. Here we show, using human functional MRI and a sensorimotor adaptation task involving the transfer of learning from the trained to untrained hand, that the transfer phase of adaptation re-instantiates a highly similar large-scale pattern of brain activity to that observed during initial adaptation. Notably, we find that these neural changes, rather than occurring at the level of sensorimotor regions, predominantly occur across distributed areas of higher-order transmodal cortex, specifically in regions of the default mode network (DMN). Moreover, we show that these learning-related neural changes relate to the structural properties of transmodal cortex (its myelin content and neurotransmitter receptor density), and that intersubject differences in DMN activity relate to both adaptation- and transfer-phase task performance. Together, these findings suggest that the transfer of learning across the hands is supported by the re-expression of the same activity patterns in the DMN as those that support initial learning. Collectively, these results offer a unique characterization of the whole-brain macroscale changes associated with sensorimotor learning and generalization, and establish a key role for higher-order brain areas, such as the DMN, in the transfer of learning to untrained scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background and Hypothesis Disorganized thinking is a prominent feature of schizophrenia that becomes persistent in the presence of treatment resistance. Disruption of the default mode network (DMN), which regulates self-referential thinking, is now a well-established feature of schizophrenia. However, we do not know if DMN disruption affects disorganization and contributes to treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). Study Design This study investigated the DMN in 48 TRS, 76 non-TRS, and 64 healthy controls (HC) using a spatiotemporal approach with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We recovered DMN as an integrated network using multivariate group independent component analysis and estimated its loading coefficient (reflecting spatial prominence) and Shannon Entropy (reflecting temporal variability). Additionally, voxel-level analyses were conducted to examine network homogeneity and entropy within the DMN. We explored the relationship between DMN measures and disorganization using regression analysis. Results TRS had higher spatial loading on population-level DMN pattern, but lower entropy compared to HC. Non-TRS patients showed intermediate DMN alterations, not significantly differing from either TRS or HC. No voxel-level differences were noted between TRS and non-TRS, emphasizing the continuum between the two groups. DMN's loading coefficient was higher in patients with more severe disorganization. Conclusions TRS may represent the most severe end of a spectrum of spatiotemporal DMN dysfunction in schizophrenia. While excessive spatial contribution of the DMN (high loading coefficient) is specifically associated with disorganization, both excessive spatial contribution and exaggerated temporal stability of DMN are features of schizophrenia that become more pronounced with refractoriness to first-line treatments.",

The participants received either one week of ATT or a sham intervention. Rs-fMRI scans before and after treatment were compared using seed-to-voxel analysis. Results The 2x2x2 analysis did not reach significance. Nevertheless, a resting-state connectivity effect was found on the basis of a posttest at the second measurement time point in MDD. After one week, MDD patients who had received ATT intervention presented lower functional connectivity between the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG) as well as between the right PCC and the left MFG compared to the MDD patients in the sham group. In HC we observed higher rsFC in spatially close but not the same brain regions under the same experimental condition. Conclusion We found a first hint of a change at the neural level on the basis of ATT. Whether the changes in rsFC found here indicate an improvement in the flexible shift of attentional focus due to ATT needs to be investigated in further research paradigms. Further experiments have to show whether this change in functional connectivity can be used as a specific outcome measure of ATT treatment.",

      "abstract": "Alpha (8\u201312\u2005Hz) oscillations and default mode network (DMN) activity dominate the brain's intrinsic activity in the temporal and spatial domains, respectively. They are thought to play crucial roles in the spatiotemporal organization of the complex brain system. Relatedly, both have been implicated, often concurrently, in diverse neuropsychiatric disorders, with accruing electroencephalogram (EEG)/magnetoencephalogram and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data linking these two neural activities both at rest and during key cognitive operations. Prominent theories and extant findings thus converge to suggest a mechanistic relationship between alpha oscillations and the DMN. Here, we leveraged simultaneous EEG\u2013fMRI data acquired before and after alpha-frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation (\u03b1-tACS) and observed that \u03b1-tACS tightened the dynamic coupling between spontaneous fluctuations in alpha power and DMN connectivity (especially, in the posterior DMN, between the posterior cingulate cortex and the bilateral angular gyrus). In comparison, no significant changes were observed for temporal correlations between power in other oscillatory frequencies and connectivity in other major networks. These results thus suggest an inherent coupling between alpha and DMN activity in humans. Importantly, these findings highlight the efficacy of \u03b1-tACS in regulating the DMN, a clinically significant network that is challenging to target directly with noninvasive methods.",

      "abstract": "Background: The Default Mode Network (DMN) is involved in self-referential and emotional processes, while the insula integrates emotional and interoceptive signals. Functional connectivity between the insula and the DMN is proposed to enhance these processes by linking internal bodily states with self-referential thoughts and emotional regulation. Heart Rate Variability (HRV), a measure of parasympathetic regulation of cardiac activity, has been associated with the capacity to regulate autonomic arousal. This study explored the relationship between insula\u2013DMN functional connectivity and HRV. We hypothesized that (1) insula\u2019s functional activity and volume would be related to HRV; (2) insula activation would be functionally connected with the DMN; and (3) stronger insula\u2013DMN connectivity would correlate with higher HRV. Methods: Forty-three healthy adults underwent a structural and functional MRI acquisition to assess insula\u2013DMN connectivity during resting state. HRV was measured also at rest using the BIOPAC system. Results: A significant positive correlation was found between insula\u2013DMN connectivity, but no correlation was observed between insula\u2013DMN connectivity and HRV. We also found a positive significant association between left insula volume and HRV. Conclusions: These findings suggest that while the AI and DMN are functionally interconnected, this connectivity may not be directly related to HRV. The results highlight the complexity of the relationship between brain connectivity and autonomic function, suggesting that other factors may influence HRV.",

      "abstract": "Lower back pain comprises the majority of the disease burden of patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), while the alterations of the large-scale brain networks could be implicated in the neuropathophysiology of pain. The frontoparietal network (FPN) is known as a pain modulation hub, with key nodes dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) participating in the pain modulation and reappraisal process. In this study, we adopted the analytical approaches of independent component analysis (ICA) and seed-based correlation analysis (SCA) to examine the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the large-scale brain networks, notably FPN, between 82 AS patients and 61 healthy controls (HCs). We also investigated the correlation between the rsFC and the clinical measures of AS patients. Both ICA and SCA consistently showed that the rsFC between FPN and mPFC, a key node of the default mode network (DMN), was significantly increased in AS. In addition, SCA also identified a cluster at the right posterior lobe of cerebellum which exhibited increased rsFC with the posterior cingulate cortex, and the right lateral prefrontal cortex also showed increased rsFC with the right dlPFC. Correlation analysis showed that the rsFC between mPFC and the left anterior prefrontal cortex was significantly correlated with C-reactive protein in AS. The increased FPN-DMN connectivity could contribute to the neuropathophysiology of lower back pain in AS, with potential association with faulty pain modulation and reappraisal mechanisms facilitated by the FPN.",

      "abstract": "Abstract To make optimal decisions, intelligent agents must learn latent environmental states from discrete observations. Bayesian frameworks argue that integration of evidence over time allows us to refine our state belief by reducing uncertainty about alternate possibilities. How is this increasing belief precision during learning reflected in the brain? We propose that temporal neural variability should scale with the degree of reduction of uncertainty during learning. In a sample of 47 healthy adults, we found that BOLD signal variability (SDBOLD, as measured across independent learning trials) indeed compressed with successive exposure to decision-related evidence. Crucially, more accurate participants expressed greater SDBOLD compression primarily in default mode network regions, possibly reflecting the increasing precision of their latent state belief during more efficient learning. Further, computational modeling of behavior suggested that more accurate subjects held a more unbiased (flatter) prior belief over possible states that allowed for larger uncertainty reduction during learning, which was directly reflected in SDBOLD changes. Our results provide first evidence that neural variability compresses with increasing belief precision during effective learning, proposing a flexible mechanism for how we come to learn the probabilistic nature of the world around us.",

      "abstract": "Accumulating research has shed light on the significance of skeletal interoception, in maintaining physiological and metabolic homeostasis related to bone health. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of how skeletal interoception influences bone homeostasis, delving into the complex interplay between the nervous system and skeletal system. One key focus of the review is the role of various factors such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in skeletal health via skeletal interoception. It explores how nerves innervating the bone tissue communicate with the central nervous system to regulate bone remodeling, a process critical for maintaining bone strength and integrity. Additionally, the review highlights the advancements in biomaterials designed to utilize skeletal interoception for enhancing bone regeneration and treatment of bone disorders. These biomaterials, tailored to interact with the body\u2019s interoceptive pathways, are positioned at the forefront of innovative treatments for conditions like osteoporosis and fractures. They represent a convergence of bioengineering, neuroscience, and orthopedics, aiming to create more efficient and targeted therapies for bone-related disorders. In conclusion, the review underscores the importance of skeletal interoception in physiological regulation and its potential in developing more effective therapies for bone regeneration. It emphasizes the need for further research to fully understand the mechanisms of skeletal interoception and to harness its therapeutic potential fully.",

      "abstract": "Uncomfortable sensations preceding repetitive behaviours, known as sensory phenomena, have been documented across the obsessive\u2013compulsive spectrum. Indirect evidence suggests altered interoception may play a role in these shared experiences of sensory phenomena; however, research explicitly measuring this relationship is limited. The current systematic review aimed to establish the nature of sensory phenomena and interoception in obsessive\u2013compulsive and related disorders (OCRDs) and tic disorders as potential maintaining factors of these disorders. PsycINFO, PubMed, and Scopus databases were searched from 2007 to April 2024, yielding 65 studies. While the majority of studies presented low risk of bias, significant overlap and ambiguity characterised the measurement and conceptualisation of sensory phenomena and interoception. Overall, higher sensory phenomena was associated with greater symptom severity in several obsessive\u2013compulsive spectrum disorders. Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder and tic disorder samples were characterised by lower interoceptive accuracy, with mixed findings on interoceptive sensibility. Some limited research emerged suggesting altered interoceptive abilities may be associated with greater sensory phenomena in obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder and tic disorders. Sensory phenomena are experienced across the obsessive\u2013compulsive spectrum. Future research should explore interoceptive abilities across the OCRDs, and build upon evidence supporting a relationship between sensory phenomena and interoception in OCD and tic disorders.

      "abstract": "Despite being a leading cause of chronic pain and disability, the underlying mechanisms of intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration (IVDD) remain unclear. Emerging evidence suggests that mechanosensation (the ability of the skeletal system to perceive mechanical and biochemical signals) mediated by abnormal mechanical loading plays a critical role in the regulation of IVD health. This review examines the complex interactions amongIVDs, intraosseous sensory mechanisms, and the central nervous system (CNS), with a particular focus on the roles of pathways such as PGE2/EP4, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, and NF-\u03baB. This review elucidates the manner in which mechanical stress and aberrant signaling disrupt the homeostasis of the nucleus pulposus (NP), cartilaginous endplate (CEP) and annulus fibrosus (AF), thereby driving degeneration and exacerbating pain. Furthermore, targeted therapeutic strategies, including the modulation of skeletal interoception and dynamic mechanical loading, present novel avenues for reversing IVDD progression. By integrating skeletal biology with spinal pathology, this work offers a novel perspective on the pathogenesis of IVDD and identifies promising strategies for clinical intervention. These findings highlight the potential of targeting skeletal interoception to mitigate IVDD and associated pain, paving the way for innovative, mechanism-driven therapies.",

      "abstract": "Refractory chronic cough (RCC) remains a persistent clinical challenge, often resistant to traditional treatments. Emerging evidence now positions RCC as a disorder rooted in hypersensitivity, driven primarily by central neural processes rather than external physiological causes. Central to this understanding is the concept of interoception\u2014the brain\u2019s ability to perceive and interpret internal bodily signals. Neuroimaging research has identified abnormalities in brain regions associated with interoception and inhibitory control among RCC patients. Interestingly, RCC shares neurophysiological characteristics with other disorders like overactive bladder and urinary urge incontinence (OAB/UUI), which also involve dysregulated interoceptive and inhibitory mechanisms. Behavioral treatments for OAB/UUI are highly effective and are regarded as the first-line treatment in many consensus guidelines. OAB/UUI behavioral treatments have been shown to induce central neuroplastic changes, further underscoring their efficacy and potential parallel for RCC interventions. Behavioral cough suppression therapy (BCST), an efficacious treatment for RCC, may leverage similar neuroplastic adaptations, enhancing interoceptive processing and inhibitory control. Given the multi-dimensional nature of interoception, which encompasses sensory perception shaped by learning, memory, and emotional context, BCST\u2019s engagement of multiple neural pathways offers an alternative therapeutic option compared to single-mechanism pharmacological treatments. Future research should prioritize exploring the mechanistic underpinnings of BCST and other interoception-based therapies for developing more comprehensive and effective treatment options. Such research holds promise for improving patient outcomes, alleviating the significant healthcare burden associated with RCC, and advancing our understanding of central hypersensitivity disorders.",

      "abstract": "Background Migraine is one of the most common neurological disorders. Despite advances in understanding of episodic migraine, little is understood about the mechanisms underlying the chronification of migraine. Recently, increasing attention has been given to the potential roles of interoceptive abnormalities and dissociation. Therefore, we sought to explore differences in interoception and dissociation in individuals with episodic and chronic migraine versus individuals without migraine. Methods A total of 49 participants were analysed of which 26 had migraine (15 chronic and 11 episodic) and 23 were control subjects without a headache disorder. Their objective interoceptive accuracy was assessed using the heartbeat tracking and discrimination tasks. Interoceptive sensibility was assessed using the Porges body perception questionnaire. Interoceptive trait prediction error (ITPE) was calculated based on the discrepancy between their task performance and sensibility. Interoceptive state prediction error (ISPE) was calculated based on the trial-by-trial correspondence between task performance and confidence. The level of their dissociation was assessed via self-report questionnaires. Results Patients with migraine had lower interoceptive accuracy for the tracking task (median (interquartile range) 0.50 (0.43) in migraine vs. 0.78 (0.26) in control, Mann\u2013Whitney U test, effect size r\u202f=\u202f0.35, p\u202f=\u202f0.014), higher interoceptive sensibility (110 (52) vs. 39 (14), r\u202f=\u202f0.74, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), and greater ITPE than controls (for the tracking task: 1.08 (1.78) vs.\u202f\u2212\u202f1.16 (0.88), r\u202f=\u202f0.72, p <\u202f0.001 / for the discrimination task: 0.87 (1.44) vs.\u202f\u2212\u202f0.62 (0.97), r\u202f=\u202f0.69, p <\u202f0.001). Greater ISPE was also found in patients with chronic migraine than episodic migraine (2.30 (0.35) in chronic vs. 1.75 (0.19) in episodic, r\u202f=\u202f0.39, p\u202f=\u202f0.046). A greater level of somatoform dissociation was found in individuals with chronic, compared to episodic, migraine (27 (11) vs. 22 (2), r = 0.43, p\u202f=\u202f0.029). Conclusion This is the first study to demonstrate interoceptive abnormalities in migraine, specifically of greater interoceptive prediction errors. Interoceptive abnormalities may represent a transdiagnostic mechanisms relevant to the chronification of migraine, and to frequent co-morbidities such as dissociation.",

      "abstract": "The psychological structural model of major depressive disorder (MDD) is complex and multifaceted, consisting of the environment factors (EF), cognitive function (CF), and behavioral-emotional manifestations (BEM). Currently, the diagnosis and treatment of MDD is difficult to improve the disease state as a whole through an intervention point. Constructing the psychological structural model of MDD and finding the critical node of the psychological structural model are meaningful for the diagnosis and treatment of MDD. 308 MDD patients (MDDs) participated in this research. They completed assessments of 34 psychological factors, including EF, CF, BEM and interoception function (IF). Pearson correlation was used to investigate the relationship between IF and each factor in the depressive multidimensional psychological structural model (EF, CF and BEM) which was constructed by structural equation modeling (SEM). Critical nodes were identified by the goodness of fit of the model. The depressive multidimensional psychological structural model (EF, CF and BEM) was created through SEM. IF was added to the depressive multidimensional psychological structural model to further verify the pathways and effects of interoception in the network. IF was significantly correlated with all psychological factors. In the depressive multidimensional psychological structural model, EF (\u03b2direct\u2009=\u20090.163, p\u2009=\u20090.033) and BEM (\u03b2direct\u2009=\u20090.230, p\u2009=\u20090.003) can directly influence MDD. When adding IF to the model, interoception predicted all the factors in the model. The poorer EF led to the lower IF (\u03b2direct\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.346, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Interoception dysfunction increased the risk of the CF (\u03b2direct = -0.525, p\u2009=\u20090.002) and BEM (\u03b2direct\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.250, p\u2009=\u20090.031) of the patients. EF had the largest total effect on MDD (\u03b2direct\u2009=\u20090.365, \u03b2indirect\u2009=\u20090.150, \u03b2total\u2009=\u20090.515), IF (\u03b2direct\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.309, \u03b2indirect\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.126, \u03b2total\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.434) are second only to EF. IF is a part of the psychological structural model of MDD that predicts EF, CF, and BEM. It could be a potential intervention point to improve the depressive state as a whole.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies demonstrated that sensorimotor training enhances interoceptive abilities. Athletes are highly engaged in performance\u2010driven physical training and often incorporate\u2014to varying degrees\u2014sensorimotor training into their routines. In this study, we investigated the role of individual differences in interoception by comparing professional athletes of different performance levels and both sexes with recreational athletes and controls, applying a three\u2010dimensional model of interoception. Twenty\u2010six elite athletes, 52 recreational athletes, and 50 college students were recruited from national sports teams, local sports training centers, and local universities. We used the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoperative Awareness (MAIA), the Heartbeat Detecting Task (HDT), and a numeric rating scale based on HDT to measure interoceptive sensibility, accuracy, and awareness. At average, athletes showed significantly higher interoceptive sensibility, interoceptive accuracy, and interoceptive awareness than controls. Elite athletes reported significantly higher scores in all measures of interception compared to recreational athletes. Intriguingly, Non\u2010Distracting for interoceptive sensibility was positively correlated with the level of experience in elite athletes. Male athletes had better interoceptive sensibility and interoceptive awareness compared to female athletes in the elite group, while no significant sex differences were detected in the other two groups. These results indicated that level of sport experience and sex are associated with differences in interoceptive accuracy, interoceptive sensibility, and interoceptive awareness. It also suggests that interoceptive ability is possibly an experience\u2010dependent trait for athletic performance, which provides insight for improving sports performance through an approach of enhancing interoceptive ability.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the interplay between interoception and emotional regulation is critical for advancing occupational therapy practices for autistic children and adolescents. These individuals often experience interoceptive processing difficulties, hindering emotional management, daily functioning, and societal participation. This review examines the relationship between interoception and emotional regulation and addresses relevant interventions to support these skills. To explore the relationship between interoception and emotional regulation and identify effective interventions that can inform occupational therapy practices for autistic individuals. A comprehensive search was conducted across three central electronic databases\u2014 PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar to identify studies that examined the relationship between interoception and emotional regulation in individuals with autism. Studies were conducted from 2013 to 2024. The search combined database-specific controlled language with keywords related to interoception, emotional regulation, occupational therapy, and autism spectrum disorder. A total of 49 studies meeting inclusion criteria were included. The review highlights the intricate connections between interoception and emotional regulation in autistic children, emphasizing challenges such as alexithymia and reduced interoceptive awareness. Interventions include cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based approaches, and specialized programs like the Aligning Dimensions of Interoceptive Experience and the Interoception Curriculum. These strategies can potentially enhance emotional well-being, self-regulation, and occupational engagement. Interoception and emotional regulation are foundational elements in the clinical reasoning of occupational therapists. Tailored, neurodiversity-affirmative interventions can promote emotional resilience and improve participation in daily activities for autistic individuals. Further research is necessary to develop inclusive and ethically aligned interventions that meet the needs of both clinicians and autistic people. This study underscores the significance of integrating interoceptive-based interventions into therapeutic practices to address emotional regulation challenges in autistic children, fostering their holistic development and societal inclusion.",

      "abstract": "Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory gynaecological condition frequently associated with chronic pelvic pain. Visceral hypersensitivity could be present, like in other chronic pain conditions, causing altered levels of interoception. So far, studies have explored interoceptive deficits in chronic pain individuals mainly using questionnaires or cardiac interoceptive accuracy tasks. Here, we explore the cardiac, gastric, and urinary domains to probe interoceptive differences between patients with endometriosis and healthy women. 30 patients and 30 controls underwent three interoceptive tasks for assessing the cardiac domain (using the Heartbeat Counting Task, HCT), the gastric domain (using the Water Load Test-II, WLT-II) and the bladder domain (using a novel Urinary Interoceptive Task, UIT). Participants also completed bladder interoceptive beliefs measures and subjective pain ratings for each endometriosis symptom (dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dyschezia, chronic pain). A positive correlation between the WLT-II and the UIT emerged in all participants (R\u2009=\u20090.47, p\u2009<\u20090.001), indicating that the lower the gastric interoceptive abilities, the lower the urinary ones. Moreover, compared to healthy controls, women with endometriosis exhibited lower scores in the WLT-II (t(58) = 4.6814, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and the UIT (t(39.931)= 5.1462, p\u2009<\u20090.001), as well as higher scores in the subjective bladder beliefs questions (t(57.346)= -4.0304, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Results indicate a dissociation between patients\u2019 poor objective performance on interoceptive tasks and their high bladder interoceptive beliefs. UIT scores were associated with pain symptoms, suggesting that patients, probably due to sensitisation, struggle to ignore discomfort sensations, resulting in reduced accuracy in detecting physiological signals coming from the pelvic area.",

      "abstract": "Interoception, the perception of internal visceral states, arises from complex brain-body interactions across the central and peripheral nervous systems. Despite noradrenaline\u2019s key role in these interactions, its specific contribution to interoceptive processes remains unclear. In a placebo-controlled, randomised, within-subject study, we employed computational modelling of interoceptive psychophysics to determine how pharmacological beta-adrenoceptor antagonism controls interoception across cardiac and respiratory domains. Both cardio-selective bisoprolol and non-selective propranolol improved cardiac perceptual sensitivity, with bisoprolol exerting an enhanced effect on cardiac metacognition. In contrast, both beta-blockers increased respiratory perceptual precision, with no corresponding changes in sensitivity or metacognition. These findings reveal a novel dissociation between central and peripheral beta-adrenergic mechanisms in interoception, highlighting the pivotal role of peripheral noradrenaline in regulating multi-organ brain-body interactions. Our results suggest that beta-blockers may provide promising routes for modulating distinct facets of interoception, potentially opening new avenues for intervention in conditions characterised by disrupted bodily self-awareness.",

Nevertheless, it remains poorly understood how different interoceptive dimensions (e.g., self-report) and organ systems (e.g., cardiac, gastric) relate to each other and to disordered eating behaviors such as emotional, external and restrained eating. We assessed multiple dimensions (behavioral, self-reported, and physiological) in the cardiac domain (interoceptive accuracy, interoceptive self-report, interoceptive insight and objective physiological state) and in the gastric domain (gastric interoceptive sensitivity, gastric attribution of interoceptive sensations, interoceptive self-report, interoceptive insight and objective physiological state). The first goal of this study was to examine the relationship between cardiac and gastric interoception measured via multiple dimensions (behavioral, self-reported, and physiological). The second goal was to investigate whether multidimensional gastric interoception was a more important predictor of emotional, external and restrained eating than multidimensional cardiac interoception. Our sample (n\u2009=\u2009128) was predominantly female (n\u2009=\u2009116), included healthy individuals (n\u2009=\u200987) and individuals with an eating disorder or sub-clinical eating disorder (n\u2009=\u200941). Instruments included a heartbeat counting task, the two-step Water Load Test, electrocardiogram, electrogastrogram and the Dutch-Eating Behaviour Questionnaire. We used correlation analysis, multiple regressions, and LASSO regressions. The final sample included in the multiple regression and LASSO regressions resulted in N\u2009=\u200989. Results showed cardiac and gastric interoception to be distinguishable, yet not to be entirely independent processes. Results further suggest gastric and not cardiac interoception to be the most important predictor of emotional, external and restrained eating. Specifically gastric attribution of interoceptive sensations played the most important role in all disordered eating behaviors. Our findings highlight the importance of the gastric system in the assessment and targeted treatment of disordered eating behaviors. Future research should consider adding additional interoceptive dimensions. This study examined how awareness of stomach (gastric) and heart (cardiac) signals relates to disordered eating behaviors, such as eating due to emotions, external cues, or restricting food intake. These behaviors increase the risk of eating disorders and are often elevated in those affected. Interoception, which can influence behaviors and emotions, includes multiple aspects, such as sensing and interpreting internal body signals but also the body signal itself. This study aimed to determine whether gastric interoception is more important than cardiac interoception in predicting these eating behaviors. The study involved 128 participants, mostly women, including healthy individuals and those with eating disorders. Interoception was assessed using tasks like counting heartbeats, drinking water to feel full, and questionnaires about bodily signal perception and eating behaviors. Results showed gastric and cardiac interoception are distinct but share some links. Awareness of stomach signals was a stronger predictor of disordered eating than awareness of heart signals. Feeling negative after drinking water until full was most strongly associated with disordered eating These findings emphasize the importance of stomach signal awareness in understanding and treating eating disorders. Future research should explore other aspects of interoception to improve treatments for these conditions.",

      "abstract": "Internal bodily signals, notably the heartbeat, influence our perception of the external world \u2013 but the nature of this influence remains unclear. Different frameworks, originating in opposing views of the function of interoception, have developed largely in parallel. One line of evidence (Internal/External Competition) indicates that interoceptive and exteroceptive inputs compete for neural resources. Another line (Self-related Facilitation) shows a link between interoceptive and self-related processing, which might include computing the self-relevance of exteroceptive inputs. We contrasted these accounts within a single experimental task for which they yielded distinct predictions. We measured heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs, a measure of cardiac interoception) with EEG, and manipulated the self-relevance of an audio-tactile stimulus by placing the audio source either inside or outside the peripersonal space immediately around the body. On one hand, pre-stimulus HEP amplitudes over somatosensory cortex were linked to slower reaction times, and affected audio-tactile stimulus-evoked responses in the same area, indicating competition for shared neural resources. On the other hand, pre-stimulus HEPs over integrative sensorimotor and default-mode network regions facilitated stimulus self-relevance encoding, both in reaction times and audio-tactile evoked responses. Importantly, Competition and Facilitation effects were spatially and statistically independent from each other. We therefore reconcile the two views by showing the co-existence of two independent mechanisms: one that allocates neural resources to either internal bodily signals or the external world, and another by which interoception and exteroception are combined to determine the self-relevance of external signals. Our results highlight the multi-dimensionality of HEPs, and of internal states more generally. Significance Statement Do internal bodily signals distract us from the external world (Internal/External Competition account)? Or do internal signals contribute to conscious perception, by situating the perceived external world relative to the organism (Self-related Facilitation account)? So far, both accounts \u2013 reflecting fundamentally different views of brain-body interactions \u2013 received experimental support, but have never been compared directly. We measured neural responses to heartbeats, and tested how they influenced perception in an audio-tactile reaction time task where self-relevance was manipulated. We found evidence for both accounts, reflecting independent mechanisms in distinct brain regions. Our results reconcile two hitherto independent and seemingly contradictory research programmes on the relationship between interoception and exteroception. They further highlight the multi-dimensionality of cardiac-brain interactions, and hence of internal state.",

      "abstract": "The interoceptive nervous system uses signalling mechanisms distinct from those of exteroceptive, voluntary motor, cognitive and linguistic processes. While interoception relies mainly on analogue-like processing, the other systems favour digital-like signalling. This physiological feature allows interoception to map the state of the organism\u2019s internal milieu in real time, in stark contrast to the rapid, precise and time-sensitive processing of exteroceptive, proprioceptive, cognitive and linguistic signals. This distinction arises from the unique features of the interoceptive process, namely the unmyelinated and lightly myelinated nature of afferent interoceptive neurons, which facilitates non-synaptic signalling throughout interoceptive pathways, notably in those of the vagus nerve and of neural structures devoid of a blood\u2013brain barrier. We propose that by continuously representing the body\u2019s state, spontaneously conscious homoeostatic feelings constitute the foundational substrate of subjectivity and the grounding for consciousness. This idea builds on our prior work, which grounds consciousness in core biology rather than high-level cognition. Consciousness enables adaptive and protective responses that maintain homeostasis and secure life. This article is part of the theme issue \u2018Evolutionary functions of consciousness\u2019.",

We delve into the concept of interoception and its impact on heart failure (HF) by reviewing and exploring neural mechanisms underlying interoceptive processing. Furthermore, we review the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnosis, biomarker development, and HF treatment. In the context of HF, AI algorithms can analyze and interpret complex interoceptive data, providing valuable insights for diagnosis and treatment. These algorithms can identify patterns of disease markers that can contribute to early detection and diagnosis, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes. These biomarkers hold significant potential in improving the precision/efficacy of HF. Additionally, AI\u2010powered technologies offer promising avenues for treatment. By leveraging patient data, AI can personalize therapeutic interventions. AI\u2010driven technologies such as remote monitoring devices and wearable sensors enable the monitoring of patients' health.

      "abstract": "Introduction\n Interoception\u2014the process of sensing, interpreting, and integrating internal bodily signals\u2014plays a critical role in emotional regulation, behaviour, and wellbeing. In counselling and psychotherapy contexts, impaired interoception is increasingly recognised as associated with how clients experience and respond to stress, trauma, and mental illness. This scoping review aimed to explore the relationship between interoception and these psychological conditions and to determine whether they are associated with heightened (hyper) or reduced (hypo) interoceptive sensitivity.\n Method\n A scoping review methodology was used, involving a comprehensive search of four major databases\u2014MEDLINE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), and CINAHL (EBSCO)\u2014for peer-reviewed articles published between 2014 and October 2024. The screening process included title and abstract screening followed by full text review. Data were synthesised narratively.\n Results\n \n A total of 48 studies were included, covering trauma (\n n\n = 17), mental health conditions (\n n\n = 14), eating disorders (\n n\n = 10), and stress-related physical health issues (\n n\n = 7). Most studies reported impaired interoception across these conditions. Reduced awareness and interpretation of bodily signals (hypo-sensitivity) were more commonly reported than heightened sensitivity, although variability existed across conditions.\n \n Conclusion\n Findings support the relevance of interoception and its relationship to wellbeing in counselling and psychotherapy. In particular, findings suggest that trauma, especially interpersonal trauma, may be associated with clients\u2019 tendencies to avoid bodily awareness, potentially as a protective strategy, and this may co-occur with increased external vigilance. These insights underscore the value of trauma-informed and body-oriented therapeutic approaches. Supporting clients in safely reconnecting with their bodily experiences may enhance emotional regulation and facilitate psychological healing in counselling and psychotherapy settings.",

      "abstract": "Interoception, the process by which the nervous system senses, interprets, and regulates internal bodily states, is fundamental in maintaining physiological homeostasis, emotional regulation, and cognitive processing. Despite its significance, significant knowledge gaps persist regarding their underlying neural mechanisms, contributions to psychiatric and neurological disorders, methodological limitations in assessment, and potential clinical applications. This review synthesizes current findings and highlights unresolved questions in interoceptive research. The insular cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, brainstem, and autonomic nervous system are integral to interoceptive processing, yet the precise functional interactions among these regions remain unclear. Disruptions in interoceptive signaling have been implicated in psychiatric conditions such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder, as well as neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s. However, whether these interoceptive alterations are causative or consequential remains an open question. Inconsistencies in interoception assessment methods hinder progress, necessitating standardized, multimodal approaches that integrate behavioral, physiological, and computational metrics. Emerging evidence supports the clinical potential of interoception-based interventions, including mindfulness, vagus nerve stimulation, biofeedback, and cognitive behavioral therapy. Yet, their mechanisms of action and efficacy across diverse populations require further investigation.

Motor imagery (MI) training improves sensorimotor and cognitive\u2013emotional functions. This study aimed to (a) compare sedentary and artistic gymnastics-practicing young females and (b) evaluate the changes in interoception and performance satisfaction occurring in gymnastics-practicing participants after one month of motor imagery training. Materials and Methods: The difference in interoceptive accuracy (IA) and sensibility (IS) between young sedentary females (Control group, C, n = 27) and age-matched females practicing artistic gymnastics (Experimental group, E, n = 27) were studied using the Interoceptive Accuracy Scale (IAS), the Multisensory Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA), and Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ). The capacity for focusing one\u2019s attention on specific tasks (absorption) was assessed by the Tellegen Absorption Scale (TAS). Groups were compared at T0 (before motor imagery training). In group E, the same variables and satisfaction with performance were rated before and after 1 month of motor imagery training. The years of practice and absorption were used as covariates in analyses. Results: (a) Group E exhibited significantly higher scores in the MAIA dimensions than group C and similar BPQ and IAS scores; (b) group E\u2019s satisfaction with performance, MAIA, IAS, and BPQ scores increased significantly from T0 to T1. The increase in performance satisfaction became non-significant when using years of practice as the control. The improvement in MAIA dimensions became non-significant when using TAS as the control. Conclusions: Despite the limitations as a result of the absence of an objective evaluation of the performance and physiological correlations of mental imagery and interoceptive accuracy, the baseline differences between the two groups confirm that practicing artistic gymnastics improves interoception. The experience undergone by group E of better performance after training is associated with further improvement in interoceptive intermingled pathways and shared relay stations of sensorimotor and interoceptive information. The results are relevant to the setting up of personalized mental training to improve physical and mental health.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nCognitive decline is common among older adults residing in nursing homes, yet the role of sensory processing and interoception in associating cognitive performance remains underexplored. Institutional care environments may exacerbate risks through reduced or imbalanced sensory stimulation.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis study investigated whether sensory processing characteristics and interoception are associated with cognitive functioning in older adults living in nursing homes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA cross-sectional study was conducted with 50 nursing home residents aged 65\u2009years and older. Participants completed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Adult Sensory Processing Scale (ASPS), and the Interoception Sensory Questionnaire (ISQ). Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine associated factors of cognitive performance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe model explained 44.1% of the variance in cognitive status (R2\u2009=\u20090.441, p\u2009<\u20090.01). Interoception (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.391, p\u2009<\u20090.01) emerged as a positive associated factor of cognition. In contrast, over-responsiveness to visual stimuli was negatively associated with cognitive performance (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.321, p\u2009=\u20090.02). Proprioceptive seeking behavior was also a positive associated factor (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.305, p\u2009=\u20090.02).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nInteroception, proprioceptive seeking, and visual over-responsiveness emerged as key associated factors of cognitive performance among nursing home residents. These findings demonstrate that cognitive health in late life is not only a matter of neurological decline but is also closely intertwined with sensory functioning and environmental stimulation. By highlighting sensory domains that are often overlooked, our study provides novel evidence for the importance of applying cognitive and holistic programs that include interoception, proprioceptive seeking, and visual responsiveness, together with the enrichment of nursing home environments.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Interoception is crucial for emotional processing. It relies on the bidirectional connections between the insula, a crucial structure in interoception, and the frontal lobe, which is implicated in emotional experiences. Acquired frontal brain injury often leads to emotional disorders. Our goal was to explore the interoceptive profiles of patients with frontal lesions with or without insular involvement. Method: Given the neuroanatomical links between interoception and emotions, we conducted a systematic Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guided review of studies assessing at least one dimension of interoception in adults with acquired frontal injuries, with or without associated insular lesions. Results: Seven articles were included. The review indicated that interoceptive accuracy declines after frontal injuries. The two studies that investigated interoceptive sensitivity found lower scores in patient groups. Finally, inconsistent results were found for interoceptive metacognition after frontal damage. Conclusions: This review is the first to explore interoceptive disorders after acquired frontal brain injury. The findings reveal deficits in cardiac interoceptive accuracy and interoceptive sensitivity following frontal damage. Inconsistent results were observed for interoceptive metacognition. Further research is needed to confirm the presence of interoceptive deficits following a frontal lesion. Additionally, the relationship between interoceptive deficits and emotional disorders, often reported after frontal brain injury, should be investigated.",

      "abstract": "Background Chronic pain has been linked to increased awareness of but decreased accuracy in detecting internal sensations. Interoception, the sense of signals from inside the body, may be a therapeutic target to improve pain. No studies have examined the feasibility of targeting interoceptive skills within a yoga intervention for chronic pain \u2013 where direct engagement with challenging sensations may be difficult \u2013 or whether yoga improves any measure of interoception among persons with chronic pain. Objective The primary aim was to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a 6-week interoception-based yoga intervention in a population of mixed chronic pain. The second aim was to examine the preliminary effectiveness on 2 measures of interoception (interoceptive sensibility and interoceptive accuracy), pain and psychosocial outcomes. Methods This was a single-arm feasibility study. Primary outcomes were feasibility and acceptability. Secondary outcomes included self-report measures of interoceptive sensibility (Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness, Version 2), pain intensity, pain interference, mindfulness, spiritual well-being and physical and mental health-related quality of life. Interoceptive accuracy was assessed with heartbeat counting. All measures were collected at baseline and after 6 weeks. Results The 6-week interoception-based yoga intervention demonstrated feasibility and high acceptability in a sample of mixed chronic pain. Twenty-six participants consented, 24 started the intervention (mean age 42.5 years, 75% female) and 19 (79%) completed 6-week post-intervention testing. The average attendance rate was 69%. There were no serious adverse events and acceptability ratings were high (>5/7). While not powered to make conclusions, preliminary analyses revealed a statistically significant increase in interoceptive sensibility and interoceptive accuracy, and reduction in pain (p\u2019s < .05). There were no correlations between the 2 measures of interoception. Conclusion The intervention appears feasible and acceptable and shows promise for improving pain and multiple dimensions of interoception, especially those involved in consciously attending to the body. Future studies examining the efficacy of interoception-oriented yoga interventions for chronic pain are warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT06268197 Registered February 12, 2024.",

      "abstract": "Most autistic adolescents experience anxiety. Interoception, defined as one\u2019s ability to detect and interpret bodily signals, might contribute to this. The aim of this exploratory, qualitative study was to gain a better understanding of interoceptive experiences in autistic adolescents and how this relates to anxiety. Semi-structured 1:1 interviews were conducted with 13 UK-based, autistic adolescents, aged 14\u201317 years, who reported experiencing significant, day-to-day anxiety. Interviews were analysed using a reflexive thematic analysis approach. Interoception appeared relevant to experiences of anxiety in most participants, although this influence was exerted through various routes. While hypoawareness of interoceptive signals led to a reduced ability to detect and regulate anxiety, hyperawareness became overwhelming and anxiety-inducing. Overly negative evaluations of interoceptive signals, including catastrophising about the signals indicating danger, also triggered anxiety. Relationships between interoception and anxiety appeared bidirectional, with anxiety also affecting interoceptive awareness and evaluation. Interoceptive experiences were variable both across and within participants, with factors such as arousal and cognitive overload affecting experiences. Future research should focus on assessing the feasibility of interventions based on the mechanisms identified here. Lay abstract Anxiety is common in autistic adolescents. The detection and interpretation of signals coming from inside the body (e.g. heartbeat and hunger) is assumed to be related to both anxiety and autism. We interviewed 13 autistic 14- to 17-year-olds who reported experiencing significant anxiety, to explore the role that bodily signals played in their experiences of anxiety. Across most participants, there did appear to be a relationship, although the exact way it was related varied. When participants were very aware of bodily signals, they could become overwhelming, but if they were not aware at all, then it was difficult for them to notice themselves getting anxious until it was too late. If participants interpreted these signals negatively, for example, assuming the signals meant something was wrong with their body, they were also more likely to feel anxious. Whether participants were aware or negatively evaluated these signals was very variable and appeared to be context-dependent.",

      "abstract": "Mindfulness meditation training may cultivate interoceptive awareness and provide therapeutic benefit when implemented within mental and physical health interventions. This pre-registered meta-analysis evaluated the impact of mindfulness interventions on self-reported interoception measures and associated relationships with psychological outcomes. Twenty-nine randomized controlled trials with 2,191 participants (77.8% female, mean age 32.8 years) were meta-analyzed using correlated and hierarchical effects models. Interventions included mindfulness-based programs (k = 15), body-based approaches (incorporating elements like massage, k = 8), and other variations (k = 6). Five SIMs were tested; the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness was the most common (22 studies). Results showed a small-to-medium positive effect on interoception measures across all studies (g = 0.31, p < 0.001, 95% CI [0.21, 0.42]) with low-to-moderate heterogeneity (\u03c4 = 0.16). Mindfulness-based programs demonstrated the largest effects (g = 0.41). No evidence of publication bias was found. No other moderators, such as practice dosage or clinical sample, were significant. Improvements in self-reported interoception were similar in size to improvements in self-reported mindfulness and were related to improvements in psychological distress. These meta-analytic findings provide evidence that mindfulness-based interventions lead to adaptive changes in the subjective experience of interoception, perhaps contributing to improved mental wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The context for our paper comes from the neurophenomenology (NPh) research programme initiated by Francisco Varela at the end of the 1990s. Varela\u2019s working hypothesis was that, to be successful, a consciousness research programme must progress by relating first-person phenomenological accounts of the structure of experience and their third-person counterparts in neuroscience through \u201cmutual constraints\u201d. Leveraging Bayesian mechanics, in particular deep parametric active inference, we demonstrate the potential for epistemically advantageous mutual constraints between phenomenological, computational, behavioural, and physiological vocabularies. Specifically, the dual information geometry of Bayesian mechanics serves to establish, under certain conditions, generative passage between lived experience and its physiological instantiation. This paper argues for the epistemological necessity of such a passage and the inclusion of trained reflective awareness in neurophenomenological empirical approaches. In particular, it showcases incremental explanatory gains for the scientist that arise from incorporating the participants\u2019 epistemic insights, shifting the focus from the contents of experience (i.e. what a subject experiences in a given experimental set-up) to the how of experience (i.e. the activities of consciousness that allow for a meaningful world to appear to us as such in lived experience). The explanatory power of the resulting \u2018meta-Bayesian\u2019 framework, deep computational NPh, arises from the disciplined circulation between first and third-person perspectives enabled by the formalism of deep parametric active inference, where parametric depth refers to a property of generative models that can form beliefs about the parameters of their own modelling process. Hence, this computational formalism contributes to understanding consciousness by bridging phenomenological descriptions and physiological instantiations, whilst also highlighting the significance of trained first-person investigation in experimental protocols.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Lived experience is shaped by intersubjective, social, cultural, and historical dimensions. For the past 30 years, neurophenomenology has adopted an embodied perspective of the mind by integrating first-person experiential and third-person neurobehavioural perspectives. Neurophenomenology reveals mutual constraints between both, as they co-constitute a person\u2019s lived experience. This article emphasizes the intersubjective and social facets of lived experience as core to generative neurophenomenology, envisioned in the 1990s by Francisco Varela, and argues that the scientific community is now ready to adopt this approach. For this endeavour, we clarify three meanings of \u2018generative\u2019 as it applies distinctly to generative phenomenology, generative passages, and generative models. Then, we propose to combine existing methods to update neurophenomenology program: first, by transitioning from individual to multiple people phenomenology methods that include intersubjectivity experience; second, by expanding traditional neuroscience to include measures of multimodal interpersonal synchrony; and third, by leveraging multiple computational tools to integrate different viewpoints, thereby enriching our understanding of lived experience. We also underscore the potential of diverse mathematical formalisms to capture aspects of human experience, all while underscoring that using computational approaches to model neurophenomenology does not entail endorsing computationalism as a grounding hypothesis of human experience. Finally, we illustrate the clinical relevance of this paradigm through two case studies in psychiatry\u2014(1) with interactive dyads in autism and (2) with multiple members in family therapy sessions\u2014demonstrating its translational potential.",

      "abstract": "Introduction We previously proposed a neurophenomenological model of schizophrenia, linking basic self-disturbance with neural deficits of source monitoring and aberrant salience. Baseline comparisons in ultra-high risk (UHR) and first-episode psychosis (FEP) samples indicated a relationship between basic self-disturbance and source monitoring deficits, but not aberrant salience. The current paper reports on the 12-month follow-up results in the UHR group (n = 43), focusing on the association between baseline variables and clinical outcomes. Methods One-way ANOVA compared UHR-remitters (n = 18), UHR-persistent/transitioned to psychosis cases (n = 25) and FEP (n = 38) groups on baseline clinical and neuro-measures. Logistic regression assessed the baseline variables\u2019 predictive power for UHR outcomes. Results Higher baseline self-disturbance scores (EASE total) were found in the UHR persistence/transition and FEP groups compared to the UHR-remission group, and predicted worse UHR clinical outcomes. Source monitoring deficits were higher in FEP individuals compared to those with UHR persistence/transition. Conclusion High levels of basic self-disturbance may be a useful predictor marker of poor prognosis in UHR patients.",

      "abstract": "Serotonergic psychedelics, particularly psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and dimethyltryptamine (DMT), are increasingly recognised as powerful tools to advance the understanding of consciousness and its relation to brain activity. Psychedelic research has informed neuroscientific theories that attempt to map neural observations of network connectivity and signal diversity to phenomenological qualities like psychological flexibility. Thus far, however, there have been relatively limited efforts to bridge the gap between psychedelic-informed theory and the experiential differences observed in neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism. In this narrative review and conceptual synthesis, we compare the psychedelic state and autism in adults from a neurophenomenological perspective. Predictive processing is invoked as a unifying framework. This procedure highlights both phenomena as involving a shift towards sensory information relative to prior knowledge, but potentially implicating alterations at opposite ends of the cortical hierarchy. This contrastive approach also reveals opportunities for refining concepts\u2014including psychological flexibility\u2014as well as interpretations of results across fields. However, neurobiological findings, especially in autism, are heterogeneous and there are inherent restrictions in comparing transient state and lifelong trait phenomena. Conclusions of this comparison are primarily conceptual and offer testable hypotheses for the neurophenomenology of the psychedelic state, autism, and their interaction.",

      "abstract": "Auditory verbal hallucinations [AVH] are one of the most common psychopathological symptoms in psychosis and schizophrenia [SZ]. While various studies demonstrate the neuronal features of AVH in specific regions and networks including changes in structural and functional connectivity, the relation of their neuronal topography to the organization or structure of the subjects\u2019 experience, i.e. the phenomenology of their \u2018mental topography\u2019, remains yet unclear. Addressing this gap in our knowledge, we review recent findings to formulate two neurophenomenological hypotheses of AVH (which extend our earlier Resting state hypothesis). First, we hypothesize that structural and functional dysconnectivity in AVH with desynchronization and temporal fragmentation between sensory auditory, interoceptive somatic and cognitive linguistic regions [e.g., auditory cortex, insula and Broca\u2019s area] relate to the experience of analogous temporal fragmentation on the mental level, that is, among the contents in perception and thought - this is manifest in \u2018hyperreflexivity\u2019, the attribution of abnormal salience and attention to single isolated objects or elements in perception. Secondly, we propose that the topographic distinction and gradient of unimodal and transmodal regions are reduced in individuals with AVH. We hypothesize that such \u2018inner-outer neuronal topographic dedifferentiation and compression\u2019 is manifest in the experience of overlaps and confusions between the subject\u2019s outer interpersonal social and inner intrapersonal spaces \u2013 analogous to the neuronal level, this reflects an \u2018inner-outer mental topographic dedifferentiation and compression\u2019. Together, we propose two testable neurophenomenological hypotheses of AVH showing shared structural-topographic changes in both brain and experience as their \u201ccommon currency\u201d. This directly connects changes in the brain\u2019s neuronal topographic organization with the structure of experience, that is, the mental topographic organization of the subjects\u2019 experience of AVH in SZ.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Human predictive capacity underlies its adaptive strength but also the potential for existential terror. Grounded in the predictive processing framework of brain function, we recently showed using a magnetoencephalogram visual mismatch-response (vMMR) paradigm that prediction-based self-specific neural mechanisms shield the self from existential threat\u2014at the level of perception\u2014by attributing death to the \u2018other\u2019 (nonself). Here we test the preregistered hypothesis that insight meditation grounded on mindful awareness is associated with a reduction in the brain\u2019s defensiveness toward mortality. In addition, we examine whether these neurophysiological markers of death-denial are associated with the phenomenology of meditative self-dissolution (embodied training in impermanence). Methods Thirty-eight meditators pooled from a previous project investigating self-dissolution neurophenomenology underwent the vMMR task, as well as self-report measures of mental health, and afterlife beliefs. Results were associated with the previously-reported phenomenological dimensions of self-dissolution. Results Meditators\u2019 brains responded to the coupling of death and self-stimuli in a manner indicating acceptance rather than denial, corresponding to increased self-reported well-being. Additionally, degree of death acceptance predicted positively valenced meditation-induced self-dissolution experiences, thus shedding light on possible mechanisms underlying wholesome vs. pathological disruptions to self-consciousness. Conclusions The findings provide empirical support for the hypothesis that the neural mechanisms underlying the human tendency to avoid death are not hard-wired but are amenable to mental training, one which is linked with meditating on the experience of the embodied self\u2019s impermanence. The results also highlight the importance of assessing and addressing mortality concerns when implementing psychopharmacological or contemplative interventions with the potential of inducing radical disruptions to self-consciousness.",

This Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis examines musical experiences of 6 participants attending an ayahuasca ritual for personal and spiritual development at the Takiwasi Center in Peru in 2018. Findings offer pointers towards a neurophenomenology of musico-healing experiences with ayahuasca, suggesting that the conjunction of icaros and ayahuasca may contribute to psycho-neurobiological mechanisms of healing such as self-referential processing, decentering, and facilitating access to beneficial introspective/meditative states. The study offers a medical ethnomusicological contribution to the phenomenological mapping of musico-healing experiences of Amazonian curative songs under the altered state of consciousness (ASC) produced by ayahuasca.",

      "abstract": "\n The classical scientific method, particularly its deterministic approach, encounters limitations when attempting to fully capture the complexities of human beings. Although many 20th\u2010century philosophers criticized this method, their arguments were primarily philosophical. I see a need for a critique of the scientific method grounded in empirical science itself. The complexity paradigm offers the most appropriate perspective for this purpose. This paradigm emphasizes the inherent proactivity (\u2018autopoiesis\u2019 or \u2018creation from within\u2019) that manifests through will, moral choices and intrinsic motivation\u2014aspects that are difficult to comprehend using the tools of the scientific method. I argue that integrating complexity\u2010based experimental studies with phenomenology provides an adequate framework for understanding human beings. To support and exemplify this argument, I draw upon Varela's neurophenomenology concept of \u2018third person\u2019 and develop it into a new epistemological model named \u2018a third person, studying a double first person\u2019.",

      "abstract": "The article reconstructs the neurophenomenological tradition of studying reli\u00adgious practices, examines the concept of neurophenomenology developed by Francisco Varela, whose ideas were analyzed in the context of the debate over the hard problem of consciousness which broke out in the 1990s, and were com\u00adpared with those of Daniel Dennett, John Searle and David Chalmers. It was es\u00adtablished that the concept formulated by Varela formed the methodological basis for research into meditation within the neurophenomenological tradition after the 1980s. A review of the history of neurophenomonological research is given. Psychological attempts at secularizing the achievements of religious practice in the writings of Herbert Benson and Daniel Goleman were considered. It is proved that a new era in the study of religious practices begins in the 1990s, when the first meta-study on experiments with meditation was published, along with John Kabat-Zinn\u2019s book \u201cFull Catastrophe Living\u201d, and the Mind and Life institute was opened. The activities of the latter are analyzed in detail, revealing its quasi-religious foundations. The specifics of the Mind and Life summer insti\u00adtute are analyzed and its influence on neurological research development in the United States is demonstrated. It is shown that the modern phase of neurophe\u00adnomenology is characterized by two significant achievements: the mindfulness revolution and the development of contemplative studies. In conclusion, the two programs for studying of religious practices are compared, neurotheology and neurophenomenology. Neurotheologists seek to separate religious practices from their religious content, while neurophenomenologists see their activities as a mis\u00adsion to change the world through the introduction of religious practices into daily life. However, considering that neurophenomenological discussions often focus on the problem of consciousness and Buddhist mindfulness, its level of philo\u00adsophical reflection is much higher.",

      "abstract": "The present paper offers an interdisciplinary exploration of two profound concepts\u2014Kundalini, a classical yogic description of latent spiritual energy, and Microvita, a theoretical construct proposed by philosopher Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar that postulates the existence of subtle entities bridging the psychic and physical realms. Though emerging from distinct intellectual traditions\u2014ancient yogic science and modern metaphysical speculation\u2014both frameworks converge in their aim to describe the subtle interface between consciousness, energy, and matter. Drawing on insights from neuroscience, psychophysiology, quantum theory, and philosophy of mind, this paper proposes a conceptual model situating Kundalini and Microvita as complementary explanatory paradigms within consciousness studies. The discussion traces empirical evidence from meditation research, neurophenomenology, and biophysical studies of energy fields, while critically assessing methodological challenges in operationalising subtle phenomena. Furthermore, it argues that Microvita can be interpreted as informational or quasi-quantum mediators that correspond to the energetic and transformative dimensions of Kundalini activation. The proposed integrative framework highlights testable research directions\u2014such as synchrony-based neurophysiological signatures, non-local correlations, and psychophysical coherence\u2014that may bridge ancient introspective knowledge with modern scientific methods. By situating Kundalini and Microvita within a unified ontological continuum, this paper contributes to the growing discourse on how consciousness interacts with material systems, urging a balanced dialogue between traditional wisdom and empirical science.",

It delves into the profound assault on the human psyche and body experienced by soldiers grappling with combat horrors. This paper argues that a neurophenomenological framework offers a crucial lens for understanding these experiences, particularly their embodied responses to sensory overload and the enduring impact of trauma. Neurophenomenology posits that consciousness and the body are intertwined. Perceptions, emotions, and cognitions are rooted in bodily sensations. In Vietnam, soldiers endured a constant barrage of sensory stimuli: deafening artillery, the stench of death, and stifling humidity. These sensory experiences profoundly shaped their perceptions, emotions, and sense of self. \u201cThe Things They Carried\u201d vividly illustrates this embodied reality. O\u2019Brien details the soldiers\u2019 physical and psychological burdens: the weight of equipment, the constant fear, and the guilt of witnessing comrades perish. These manifest as physical weight, but also as profound dread, racing heartbeat, trembling hands, and the ever-present threat of nausea. The treacherous terrain\u2014the muddy swamps, the dense jungle\u2014contributes to a profound sense of disorientation and alienation. By examining the soldiers\u2019 experiences through a neurophenomenological framework, this paper aims to demonstrate how the sensory, bodily, and emotional dimensions of war are central to understanding the psychological and emotional impact of combat. \u201cThe Things They Carried\u201d serves as a powerful testament to the enduring power of embodied experience, highlighting the profound and lasting impact of war on the human psyche and body.",

      "abstract": "This analytical essay is aimed at developing a conceptual framework to assess how people experience the built environment both objectively and subjectively through a critical literature review of neuroarchitecture, architectural phenomenology, and neurophenomenology. Whereas both modes of human experience with the built environment are inseparable in real life, they have often been evaluated as seemingly antithetical and distinct approaches. Our experiences with the environment are mediated by our brains, for instance, our brain\u2019s neurophysiological responses to colors, shapes, or heights. Such experiences are universal. Also, our experiences are constantly refracted by our unconscious subjective and intersubjective sense-making filters in the brain. Based on the critical literature review and synthesis, this study conceptualizes a refractive neuroarchitecture phenomenology, which is defined as a study of humans\u2019 subjective and intersubjective architectural experiences through an epistemological and methodological convergence of the first- and second-person phenomenological and third-person neuroscientific methods. This conceptualization would provide intellectual significance as it attempts to integrate both objective and subjective epistemology and methodology into architectural research. For a practical implication, it is expected to demonstrate the importance of the phenomenological aspect of architectural efficacy and ways of applying neuroscientific research for place-making, including urban renewal and historic preservation.",

      "abstract": "Information from our senses, memories and thoughts is bound together into a unified whole that constitutes our experience of our world, our Umwelt. However, our ability to investigate our Umwelt through standard Western-derived neuroscience is limited, because of the third-person approach that undergirds the field. Achieving greater coherence in our understanding requires the addition of an approach which is fundamentally integrative. The most comprehensive first-person approach to the nervous system can be found in the introspective traditions of Tantric Hinduism. In this review, we explore the hierarchical ordering of the senses in Hinduism (from most gross to the most subtle, the latter being closer to consciousness), and how this may be linked to sensorimotor coupling in the parietal cortex. We demonstrate how this ordering parallels the developmental history of the sensory cortices over the course of vertebrate evolution. The synergy between biosemiotics and neurophenomenology is made clear, as the idea of a \u201cGreat Chain of Semiosis\u201d can be very helpful in understanding the reasons behind the emergence of this sensory hierarchy. The structures of the Subtle body described in Hindu Tantra should be seen as semiotic nodes used by the conscious agent in interacting with the world around it. We propose that metaphor ties together the various sensory mappings of the body at the cognitive level. Integrating insights from Hindu Tantra will help modern science better investigate questions of agency, meaning and semiosis in organisms.",

      "abstract": "Return to the Real describes how culturally prevalent narratives shape psychedelic experience. Building on Ten Berge\u2019s two-part analysis, our commentary argues that psychedelic effects are best understood within cultural feedback loops linking cultural set and setting, individual expectations, experience, and its articulation back into culture. On this view, psychedelics operate primarily as non-specific amplifiers and catalysts that magnify pre-existing beliefs, rather than revealing unmediated insights. We situate this thesis in relation to contemporary neuroscientific models of the psychedelic experience (CSTC, REBUS), humanistic and anthropological accounts, and evidence on socio-political belief change and clinical outcomes. We show how the apparent \u201cdisruptive\u201d effects of psychedelics can often be reinterpreted as context-dependent intensifications. We then identify methodological and ideological obstacles to studying culture in psychedelic science and propose a mixed-methods program, including reflexivity, discourse analytics, neurophenomenology, and naturalistic cohort comparisons, to operationalize cultural variables. Recognizing culture\u2019s constitutive role has ethical and epistemic consequences including caution with respect to metaphysical claims and\u00a0 attention to how psychedelics induce change in clinical settings.\u00a0 By bridging the humanities and cognitive neuroscience we can build a cumulative, culture-sensitive science of psychedelics.",

      "abstract": "We examine the neurobiology of intuition, a term often inconsistently defined in scientific literature. While researchers generally agree that intuition represents \u201can experienced-based process resulting in a spontaneous tendency toward a hunch or hypothesis,\u201d we establish a firmer neurobiological foundation by framing intuition evolutionarily as a pathfinding mechanism emerging from the brain\u2019s optimization of its relationship with the environment. Our review synthesizes empirical findings on intuition\u2019s neurobiological basis, including relevant brain networks and their relationship to cognitive states like insight. We propose that unsolved problems dynamically alter attractor landscapes, guiding future intuitions. We investigate \u201copportunistic assimilation\u201d through nonlinear neurodynamics and identify hippocampal sharp wave ripples as potential neural correlates of intuition, citing their role in creativity, choice, action planning, and abstract thinking. Finally, we explore intuition through two complementary perspectives: the free energy principle, which models brains as minimizing uncertainty through predictive hierarchical coding, and metastable coordination dynamics, describing the brain\u2019s simultaneous tendencies toward regional cooperation and functional autonomy. Together, these principles provide a comprehensive neurodynamical account of intuition\u2019s neurophenomenology. This Perspective article proposes a neurodynamical model of intuition as a fast, embodied pathfinding mechanism shaped by evolution. Drawing on the free-energy principle and metastability, it explores how the brain predicts, feels, and acts through dynamic coordination.",

      "abstract": "The article discusses the genesis of antinomianism in the philosophy of psychiatry, analyzes its origins in the philosophical interpretation of mental illness in the 20th century. Antinomianism is the interpretation of methods, concepts, and practices through contradictory but equal categories that set different perspectives for interpretation. The study of antinomianism has a critical orientation, i.e. (implementing Kant\u2019s critical method) is\naimed at characterizing the foundations and specifics of the philosophy of psychiatry, the nature of its problematization, its boundaries. The article reveals not only the positive achievements of the philosophy of psychiatry, but also its problem points, its modern situation. The author traces the transformation of antinomianism from the existentialphenomenological tradition in psychiatry to the philosophy of psychiatry. It is emphasized that the history of the field is based on the opposition between traditional psychiatry and a person-centered philosophical approach, within which the research perspective changes from external (objective) to internal (subjective). Based on philosophical problematization and bringing concepts rather than functives to the center of its field, philosophical psychiatry designates the main problem points of the theory with antinomic concepts that capture the non-objectifiable field of experience of a mentally ill person. Existential-phenomenological psychiatry replaces biological (anatomical) theory with phenomenological ontology, and anti-psychiatry develops a social theory (social ontology), on the basis of which it develops deinstitutional practice. The author analyses the antinomianism of the first studies of the philosophy of psychiatry as a problem field and scientific branch, the attempts to overcome it, coupled with the removal of antinomianism in neurophenomenology. The new model of consciousness develops a dialectical philosophical interpretation of mental illness, where the experience of consciousness is consistently explored simultaneously in the causal analysis of neuroscience and the structural analysis of phenomenology. This leads to the construction of a complex (philosophical and neurophysiological) theory of pathological experience. In the study of antinomianism as a platform for the philosophy of psychiatry, the article lays the basis for fundamental and applied studies of its problem field.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Addictive behaviors pose significant challenges for people with intellectual disability (ID), yet research remains limited. This umbrella review aims to synthesize evidence from systematic reviews on substance use (SU), gambling, and gaming among people with ID, focusing on prevalence and patterns, risk factors and motivations, and intervention approaches. Understanding these aspects is essential for developing effective prevention and treatment. METHOD: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Reviews (PRIOR) guidelines, two independent reviewers searched the Web of Science, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for systematic reviews and meta-analyses focused on people with ID and SU, gambling, or gaming. Quality was assessed using the JBI Checklist for Systematic Reviews. RESULTS: No eligible studies were found for gambling and gaming. Nine reviews addressed SU (alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, solvents, stimulant, and depressant drugs), revealing higher prevalence among men, adults, and those with less complex support needs. Motivational, educational, and behavioral interventions were employed. Cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational enhancement therapy, and mindfulness showed potential efficacy in increasing knowledge, motivation, and reducing SU. CONCLUSIONS: The findings underscore the importance of inclusive prevention strategies that address social determinants of health (such as socioeconomic status and living conditions), transdiagnostic protective factors, and evidence-based, person-centered, and rights-based frameworks. While SU interventions for people with ID show promise, further research and more robust designs that incorporate these conceptual perspectives is needed. Moreover, it is essential to investigate polypharmacy and behavioral addictions to address these issues from a phenomenological and contextual perspective.",
