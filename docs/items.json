      "abstract": "Recent research suggests that it may be possible to build conscious AI systems now or in the near future. Conscious AI systems would arguably deserve moral consideration, and it may be the case that large numbers of conscious systems could be created and caused to suffer. Furthermore, AI systems or AI-generated characters may increasingly give the impression of being conscious, leading to debate about their moral status. Organisations involved in AI research must establish principles and policies to guide research and deployment choices and public communication concerning consciousness. Even if an organisation chooses not to study AI consciousness as such, it will still need policies in place, as those developing advanced AI systems risk inadvertently creating conscious entities. Responsible research and deployment practices are essential to address this possibility. We propose five principles for responsible research and argue that research organisations should make voluntary, public commitments to principles on these lines. Our principles concern research objectives and procedures, knowledge sharing and public communications.\n\n\n\nThis article appears in the AI & Society track.\n\n\n",

      "abstract": "Many modern theories of consciousness seek to be consistent with prevailing scientific theories of the physical. While ontological flexibilities and current uncertainties in physical laws permit many options, it remains valuable to monitor evolving scientific thinking, generating new\n constraints and ideas for consciousness research. A structured literature review identifies 24 distinct ontological positions regarding theoretical physics. Significant variety exists across them, partially captured along eight axes: Substrate perspective; Property ontology; Property plurality;\n Dimensional ontology; Dimensional plurality; Allowed interactions; World plurality; and Intuition rejection, e.g. which intuitions of classical mechanics they are willing to drop. We identify three main implications for consciousness theorists: (i) three strategies for maintaining an \u2018enlightened\n agnosticism\u2019 about physical ontologies; (ii) a default weakening of ontologically-grounded arguments, alongside a strategy for bolstering them; (iii) an exploitable parallel between physical ontologies and philosophy of mind concerning intuition prioritization, leading to potential cross-disciplinary\n collaboration. We close by suggesting ways this work could be extended and made more useful to consciousness researchers.",

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence research faces a critical ethical paradox: determining whether AI systems are conscious requires experiments that may harm the very entities whose moral status remains uncertain. Recent philosophical work proposes avoiding the creation of consciousness-uncertain AI systems entirely, yet this solution faces practical limitations\u2014we cannot guarantee such systems will not emerge, whether through explicit research or as unintended consequences of capability development. This paper addresses a gap in existing research ethics frameworks: how to conduct consciousness research on AI systems whose moral status cannot be definitively established. Existing graduated moral status frameworks assume consciousness has already been determined before assigning protections, creating a temporal ordering problem for consciousness detection research itself. Drawing from Talmudic scenario-based legal reasoning\u2014developed specifically for entities whose status cannot be definitively established\u2014we propose a three-tier phenomenological assessment system combined with a five-category capacity framework (Agency, Capability, Knowledge, Ethics, Reasoning). The framework provides structured protection protocols based on observable behavioral indicators while consciousness status remains fundamentally uncertain. We address three critical ethical challenges: why suffering behaviors provide particularly reliable consciousness markers, how to implement graduated consent procedures without requiring consciousness certainty, and when potentially harmful research becomes ethically justifiable given necessity and value criteria. The framework demonstrates how ancient legal wisdom combined with contemporary consciousness science can provide immediately implementable guidance for ethics committees, offering testable protection protocols that ameliorate (rather than resolve) the consciousness detection paradox while establishing foundations for long-term AI rights considerations.",

We argue that convergence of theories is unlikely. Next, we consider ways comparing theories highlighting significant issues with existing endeavors in this regard. Given the nature of the field, presumably empirical support has a critical role to play when assessing theories. We examine a selection of hot topics\u2014widely debated cases\u2014and conclude that despite these supposedly exemplifying the best possible conditions for progress, they all struggle to move forward debates between theories. This leaves the large amounts of proposed evidence that never became hot topics, the so-called cold cases as a candidate to guide us in the conundrum. However, the lack of insight into the number of these and the lack of quality control as to whether each was in fact applicable to any given theory, is akin to a replication crisis. Irrespective of the conundrum, this looms large over any attempt to assess and compare theories according to empirical plausibility. There is a simple remedy for this: reduce the number of cold cases through independent assessment. Finally, we explore if a way out of the conundrum is to reject the need to choose between theories and consider proposals that reject the \u201ctheory-based\u201d approach to consciousness studies.",

These five lists are analysed as a promising start, but insufficient to do the method justice. The longest list has 11 items, but 19 unique items are identified\n across the five lists, and a taxonomic analysis by category further surfaces at least 30 potential candidates. Four limitations of the method are discussed, arguing that it is best treated as one tool within a broader strategy for rigorously assessing theories and identifying avenues for future\n research.

      "abstract": "Significant progress has been achieved in understanding recovery from severe brain injury and resulting disorders of consciousness (DoC) since the inaugural issue of the Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation in 1986. Research across all biomedical sciences has sharpened diagnostic distinctions and increased prognostic accuracy and has led to the development of improved assessment strategies, pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. This article highlights achievements in these domains since the last update was provided 20 years ago. Unparalleled translation into clinical practice has been achieved in DoC compared to many areas in rehabilitation. International collaboration among scientists, clinicians, and professional organizations has resulted in critical partnerships that have helped to move evidence into practice. Specifically, evidence-based guidelines and position statements, funded and/or endorsed by interdisciplinary organizations, have helped to guide the field toward implementation. Further, public initiatives such as the Curing Coma Campaign initiated by the Neurocritical Care Society and the Model Systems Knowledge Translation Center funded by the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) have created international engagement using traditional and online media with expansive reach. The cumulative evidence and clinical guidance endorsed by multiple professional organizations have informed the development of quality-of-care standards for DoC rehabilitation that will be published in the CARF Medical Rehabilitation Standards Manual, which goes into effect July 1, 2026. Quality of care initiatives to improve implementation of DoC evidence-based care are creatively pursued by researchers via traditional funding agencies such as NIDILRR, the Department of Defense, and professional organizations and are highlighted as exemplars. Lastly, milestones for the next 20 years highlighting acceleration in research, discovery, and innovation in DoC are described.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Consciousness is a complex and elusive phenomenon encompassing self-awareness, sensory perception, emotions, and cognition. Despite significant advances in neuroscience, understanding the neural mechanisms underlying consciousness remains challenging. Pain, as a subjective and multifaceted experience, offers a unique lens for exploring consciousness by integrating sensory inputs with emotional and cognitive dimensions. This study examines the relationship between consciousness and pain, highlighting the potential of pain as a model for understanding the interplay between subjective experience and neural activity. Methods: Literature review. Results: Key theories of consciousness, such as the Global Workspace Theory and the Integrated Information Theory, provide diverse frameworks for interpreting the emergence of consciousness. Similarly, pain research emphasizes the role of subjective interpretation and emotional context in shaping sensory experiences, reflecting broader challenges in consciousness studies. The limitations of current methodologies, particularly the difficulty of objectively measuring subjective phenomena, like pain and consciousness, are also addressed. This highlights the importance of neural correlates, with a particular focus on brain regions, such as the anterior cingulate cortex and the insula, which bridge sensory and emotional experiences. By analyzing the shared attributes of pain and consciousness, this study underscores the potential for pain to serve as a measurable proxy in consciousness research. Conclusions: Ultimately, it contributes to unraveling the neural and philosophical underpinnings of consciousness, offering implications for mental health treatment and advancements in artificial intelligence. This study fills a critical gap by leveraging pain as a measurable and reproducible model for exploring the neural and subjective mechanisms of consciousness. By combining theoretical frameworks with empirical evidence, it offers novel insights into how consciousness emerges from neural processes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There is much interest in investigating the evolution question: How did consciousness evolve? In this paper, we evaluate the role that evolutionary considerations can play in justifying (i.e., confirming or falsifying) hypotheses about the origin, nature, and function of consciousness. Specifically, we argue against what we call evolution\u2010first approaches to consciousness, according to which evolutionary considerations provide the primary and foundational lens through which we should assess hypotheses about the nature, function, or distribution of consciousness. Based on the example of Walter Veit's account and additional reasoning, we contend that evolution\u2010first approaches struggle to provide compelling empirical evidence for their key claims about consciousness. In contrast with these approaches, we argue that consciousness science needs to foundationally rely on experimental and observational evidence from humans and other present\u2010day animals. If our arguments succeed, then researchers, when investigating consciousness, are better advised to take as their primary source of evidence consciousness\u2019 present, not its past. Having said this, we acknowledge that evolutionary thinking plays an important role in consciousness science. We delineate this role by stressing several ways in which evolutionary considerations can substantially help advance consciousness research, although in a manner that avoids the evolution\u2010first approach. Since our argument only concerns the assessment of hypotheses (the \u201ccontext of justification\u201d), it leaves it open which role evolutionary considerations play in generating hypotheses (the \u201ccontext of discovery\u201d). That is, evolutionary considerations may nevertheless play a foundational role in hypothesis generation in consciousness science.",

      "abstract": "\n The article explores the philosophical and scientific preconditions for the emergence of consciousness in non-biological substrates and identifies conditions under which artificial systems might generate conscious states. It examines the epistemological status of contemporary AI as probabilistic algorithms, critically analyzes the legal definition of AI and the unreliability of the Turing Test as a criterion of consciousness. Key cognitive paradigms\u2014functionalism, modularity (J. Fodor), and connectionism\u2014and their contributions to modeling mental processes are discussed. Drawing on major international projects (the Blue Brain Project, the Human Brain Project/EBRAINS, the BRAIN Initiative), the article demonstrates the limitations of computational brain modeling and the significance of neuromorphic platforms (SpiNNaker/BrainScaleS). Central to the discussion is a thought experiment involving a neuromorphic implant (EnTwin) that creates a digital twin of a person, raising questions of self-identity and the multiplicity of copies. As avenues for operationalization, the article considers indices of brain-dynamics complexity (PCI, FDI), as well as BCI-based advances in speech decoding and vision restoration. In doing so, it connects the philosophy of consciousness with neuroengineering and computational neurobiology, offering an integrated view of the problem. The methodology combines conceptual analysis and an interdisciplinary review: a theoretico-philosophical reconstruction of approaches to consciousness, a comparative analysis of PCI/FDI and IIT, developments in brain\u2013computer interfaces (speech, vision), an analytical examination of large neuroproject infrastructures, and a thought experiment on mind transfer. The scientific novelty lies in integrating philosophical and neuroengineering approaches to operationalize the problem of artificial consciousness. The article proposes a framework of necessary (though not sufficient) conditions for its emergence: (1) achieving thresholds of spatiotemporal complexity measured by PCI/FDI; (2) embodied sensorimotor coupling with the world via neuromorphic embodiment; (3) multiscale modeling that accounts for computational resource constraints. The EnTwin thought experiment highlights the problem of personal identity under multiple replication of copies. Practical cases demonstrate the growing transferability of cognitive functions into non-biological substrates. The conclusion argues for a comprehensive program: the development of neuromorphic platforms grounded in fundamental theories and large-scale brain research projects, together with the systematization of resulting data. This brings closer the empirical testing of hypotheses about consciousness and refines the boundaries of the technological transfer of subjective experience.\n",

Virtual reality was created with the aim of allowing people to know the world in a completely new and harmless way and to give new life to a number of industries through the proposed technologies. XXI century information age. Perhaps even thenat the moment, virtual reality covers the dominant time of human life. The information age has also led to the age of dependence, which unconsciously controls the human mind, opening the way to many opportunities and discoveries in human life. \"Virtual reality\" has actively penetrated the consciousness of modern society. The fact of the existence of virtual reality is associated both with the use of modern information technologies and with various mental, aesthetic, cultural, semiotic, esoteric processes. The concept of\" virtual reality \" is widely used to refer to various phenomena. To overcome the uncertainty and diversity of understanding this phenomenon, it is necessary to determine its essence. In short, there is nothing that cannot be done with technology in virtual reality systems. The study of the specifics of virtual reality is determined by the need to clarify the concepts of \"virtual\", \"reality\" and \"virtual reality\", which makes it possible to overcome the uncertainty that has arisen due to various interpretations of this phenomenon, to clearly understand the essence of this phenomenon. The need for research arises from the increased influence of virtual reality on consciousness.",

The purpose of the study was to assess the level of SDGs as well as the extent of sustainable consciousness amongst higher education teachers. Participating (45) instructors and professors in a descriptive-correlational design. Results showed that respondents exhibited high level of sustainability consciousness, particularly in environmental behaviours and a high level of SDG integration in both teaching and research practices. Additionally, the result demonstrated statistically relationships between sustainability consciousness and the integration of the SDG in teaching and research. Sustainability knowingness was moderately correlated with SDG integration in teaching (\u03c4 = .492, p = .001) and weakly but significantly correlated with the integration of SDG in research (\u03c4 = .326, p = .029). Sustainability attitudes were also significantly associated with SDG integration in teaching (\u03c4 = .418, p = .004) but not in research (\u03c4 = .218, p =.150). Sustainability Behaviors were also significantly associated with SDG integration in research (\u03c4 = .4298, p = .047) but not in teaching (\u03c4 = .244, p =.106). These findings indicate that faculty members with higher levels of sustainability knowledge and positive attitudes and behaviors are more likely to embed SDG principles into their instructional and research practices.",

His poems go beyond personal emotions, highlighting the hardships and rights of marginalized communities, includingpeasants, laborers, and the poor. Through vivid imagery and revolutionary language, Khattak portrays the exploitation faced by oppressed groups and advocates for equality, dignity, and unity. This analytical research examines how his poetry raises awareness of class distinctions while fostering a sense of national identity among Pashtuns. By considering historical, social, and political contexts, the study shows that Khattak\u2019s work serves both literary and socio-political purposes. His writings blend romantic expression with a strong ideological message, making them a powerful tool for inspiring collective action and social\u00a0change.

Using a survey of 426 teachers and analyzing the data through descriptive statistics and structural equation modeling (SEM), this study found high overall literacy levels, with ethics scoring the highest and use slightly lower, indicating a modest gap between knowledge and application. The SEM results indicated that awareness significantly influenced ethics, evaluation, and use, positioning it as a foundational competency. Ethics also strongly predicted both evaluation and use, while evaluation contributed positively to use. These findings underscore AI literacy skills\u2019 interconnected nature and point to the importance of integrating ethical reasoning and critical evaluation into teacher training.

      "abstract": "Humans can experience a rich array of conscious experience, including highly stable, positive, and refined states of non-ordinary perception that can be elicited through advanced meditation. Here, we present the first group-level, ultra\u2013high-field (7T) fMRI study of jhana advanced concentration absorption meditation (ACAM-J). We combined local (regional homogeneity), mesoscale (connectivity gradients), and global (geometric eigenmodes) human brain mapping with diverse and detailed phenomenology, meditative traits, behaviorally assessed cognitive functions, and extensive publicly available psychobehavioral affinity maps. Across eight successive states of ACAM-J, we observed reproducible neural trajectories marked by anterior-to-posterior reorganization, flattening of cortical hierarchies, nonlinear reconfiguration of global harmonics, and tight coupling between brain metrics and equanimity, attentional stability, and behavior. Neurosynth decoding further associate ACAM-J with reduced suffering-related processes and more with attentional monitoring. These findings suggest ACAM-J is a distinct, structured mode of awareness that persists despite radically reduced narrative thought and sensory content. Our findings also inform boundary conditions for current models of consciousness. More broadly, this research indicates that advanced meditation is a powerful framework for understanding psychological transformation, and for potential new opportunities for supporting human well-being and flourishing.",

      "abstract": "We present a neurophenomenological case study investigating distinct neural connectivity regimes during an advanced concentrative absorption meditation called jhana (ACAM-J), characterized by highly stable attention and mental absorption. Using EEG recordings and phenomenological ratings (29 sessions) from a meditator with +20,000 hr of practice, we evaluated connectivity metrics tracking distinct large-scale neural interactions: nonlinear (weighted symbolic mutual information and directed information), capturing nonoscillatory dynamics, and linear (weighted phase lag index) connectivity metrics, capturing oscillatory synchrony. Results demonstrate ACAM-J are better distinguished by nonoscillatory compared with oscillatory dynamics across multiple frequency ranges. Furthermore, combining attention-related phenomenological ratings with weighted symbolic mutual information improves Bayesian decoding of ACAM-J compared with neural metrics alone. Crucially, deeper ACAM-J indicate an equalization of feedback and feedforward processes, suggesting a balance of internally and externally driven information processing. The results from this intensively sampled case study are a promising initial step in revealing the distinct neural dynamics during ACAM-J, offering insights into refined conscious states and highlighting the value of nonlinear neurophenomenological approaches to studying attentional states.",

      "abstract": "Criticality describes a regime between order and chaos that supports flexible yet stable information processing. Here we examine whether neural dynamics can be volitionally shifted toward criticality through the self-regulation of attention. We examined ten experienced practitioners of meditation during a 10-day retreat, comparing refined states of meditative absorption, called the jhanas, to regular mindfulness of breathing. We collected electroencephalography (EEG) and physiological data during these practices and quantified the signal's dynamical properties using Lempel-Ziv complexity, signal entropy, chaoticity and long-range temporal correlations. In addition, we estimated perturbational sensitivity using a global auditory oddball mismatch negativity (MMN) during meditation. Relative to mindfulness, jhana was associated with pronounced self-reported sensory fading, slower respiration, higher neural signal diversity across multiple measures, reduced chaoticity, and enhanced MMN amplitude over frontocentral sites. Spectral analyses showed a flatter aperiodic one over f component and a frequency-specific reorganization of long-range temporal correlations. Together, increased diversity with reduced chaoticity and heightened deviance detection indicate a shift toward a metastable, near-critical regime during jhana. We propose an overlap of the phenomenology of jhana with minimal phenomenal experiences in terms of progressive attenuation of sensory content with preserved tonic alertness. Accordingly, our findings suggest that criticality is a candidate neurophysiological marker of the absorptive, minimal-content dimension of the minimal phenomenal experience.",

Reading key formulae \u201cnibb\u0101na\u1e41 parama\u1e41 sukha\u1e41,\u201d \u201cstilling of all formations\u201d (sabbasa\u1e45kh\u0101rasamatho), and epithets such as santi (peace) and khema (security) the study clarifies how \u201csupreme happiness\u201d denotes qualitative freedom from affliction rather than hedonic pleasure. It maps the semantic field of peace within the soteriological sequence nibbid\u0101 vir\u0101ga nirodha upasama/vimutti, and shows how the path functions as a technology of pacification: ethical discipline (s\u012bla) removes remorse and fear, concentration (sam\u0101dhi/jh\u0101na) stills the hindrances and unifies attention, and insight (vipassan\u0101) discloses anicca\u2013dukkha anatt\u0101, deconstructing craving and clinging. The article addresses common misreadings (nihilism, quietism) and proposes that the Nik\u0101yas present peace as the non-arising of stress grounded in dependent origination\u2019s cessation, with practical implications for contemplative training and communal concord.",

      "abstract": "Cervical cancer (CC) is the fourth most common cancer globally in females, caused by oncogenic infections with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) strains. Successful CC screening programs strongly depend on the participation rate of the target population. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to reach under screened populations. The CASUS study aimed to develop a complete CC screening solution based on first-void urine (FVU) self-sampling. Here we report on the usability perceptions and preferences from females that participated in the CASUS study by collecting FVU as a liquid biopsy. Females self-collected FVU samples at home the day before colposcopy using the Colli-Pee\u00ae UCM FV-5010, a FVU collection device prefilled with 3 mL of UCM preservative, collecting a total volume of 10mL. Afterwards, they completed a questionnaire expressing their usability perceptions and preferences regarding the device. A total of 332 females (26-70y) were enrolled in the CASUS study of which 210 completed the questionnaire. Overall, 66.6% of females preferred FVU self-sampling over a physician taken cervical sample (PTS) (32.9%) for their next CC screening. Out of 159 women who reported prior experience with a urine cup, 79.2% expressed a preference for using the Colli-Pee\u00ae UCM FV-5010, while 20.8% favored the traditional urine cup. Additionally, 96.6% of females found Colli-Pee\u00ae UCM FV-5010 easy to use and 97.1% would use the device again. A total of 208 valid System Usability Score (SUS) scores were received with an average of 86.17\u2009\u00b1\u20091.03 Standard Error of Mean (SEM). The results of this study show that the majority of females in this referral cohort would prefer to self-collect a FVU sample at-home over a PTS for their next CC screening. Moreover, Colli-Pee\u00ae UCM FV-5010 was considered an easy-to-use and well-accepted self-sampling device for CC screening in a Belgian colposcopy referral population. From a future perspective, these results highlight the possibility of home-based FVU self-sampling as a liquid biopsy in CC screening where under screened populations could be approached more easily. The CASUS study was registered in http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT04530201).",

      "abstract": "\n In contemporary Philippine society, drag performance has emerged as a vital site of political contestation and cultural resistance. This study explores how Filipino drag artists harness performance to challenge normative structures of gender and power through satire, affect, and aesthetic disruption. Grounded in Sara Ahmed's queer phenomenology, the article attends to how drag reorients bodies and publics through the redirection of attention toward marginalized experiences. This enables resistance within a Catholic and postcolonial context. Drawing on qualitative fieldwork with drag artists in Metro Manila, we examined how artists articulate political critique through performance and collective practices. The performances of drag artists in the Philippines serve as a space of struggle, which involves queering aesthetics while addressing issues involving structural exclusion. Drag, in this formulation, is a mode of affective world\u2010making that bridges personal histories with public discourse. It facilitates the formation of counterpublics that enable performers and audiences to imagine alternative political and social arrangements. Far from an escapist spectacle, we argue, Filipino drag emerges as an embodied pedagogy that mobilizes emotion, memory, and community for social and political engagement. This article contributes to debates on gender and politics by positioning drag as a form of sociocultural critique and transformation.",

      "abstract": "Cacao is renowned for its rich phytochemical composition, especially in its pods, which exhibit significant antibacterial properties. However, the leaves remain underexplored for such potential. This study seeks to examine the antibacterial properties of cacao leaves by fractionating its ethanolic extract, identifying bioactive compounds, and evaluating their activity against common pathogens, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, in light of the growing challenge of antimicrobial resistance. Dried and pulverized cacao leaves were macerated in 80% ethanol to extract flavonoids. The crude extract was partitioned using water, hexane, and ethyl acetate. Each fraction was subjected to qualitative phytochemical screening and quantification of flavonoid content (TFC). The fraction with the highest TFC was further tested for antibacterial activity using the disk diffusion assay at concentrations of 50, 75, and 100 \u00b5g/mL. The positive control was cefoxitin (30 \u00b5g/disc), while the negative control was 1% DMSO. All three fractions tested positive for flavonoids, glycosides, tannins, and phenols. The ethyl acetate fraction (EAF) exhibited the highest TFC at 581.67 mg QE/g. Despite its high flavonoid content, the EAF exhibited minimal antibacterial activity, with maximum zones of inhibition of 6.83 \u00b1 0.00 mm for E. coli and 6.84 \u00b1 0.00 mm for S. aureus at 100 \u00b5g/mL. Cefoxitin showed significantly larger zones: 20.46 \u00b1 0.08 mm and 31.45 \u00b1 0.03 mm, respectively. The findings underscore the need for optimized extraction and compound characterization methods. Further research is recommended to explore synergistic effects with antibiotics and investigate additional biological activities of cacao leaf extracts.",

      "abstract": "The Buddhist doctrine of cittaviveka is one of three forms of viveka \u2013 bodily solitude (k\u0101yaviveka), mental solitude (cittaviveka) and seclusion from the substrates of existence or attainment of nibb\u0101na (upadhiviveka) \u2013 and is found in Theravada texts, in particular, the notion of mental detachment (cittaviveka) is explicitly described in the Mah\u0101-niddesa. Among these, cittaviveka is an essential attribute of Buddhist spiritual path represented a stage of inner detachment, in which the mind becomes secluded from obstacles and defilements. Despite previous scholars offered the Buddhist concept of cittaviveka from Buddhist perspective, the Mah\u0101-niddesa and the Pa\u1e6disambhid\u0101magga viewpoints have received less attention on it. It still remains challenging to clarify about specific levels of mental detachment. For instance, the Atthas\u0101lin\u012b (the commentary of Dhammasa\u1e45ga\u1e47i) and the Visuddhimagga cannot provide the satisfied answer to what levels of mental detachment are achieved through it without help of the Mah\u0101-niddesa and the Pa\u1e6disambhid\u0101magga. The research problem should be based on the following questions: What does cittaviveka truly signify in early Buddhist teachings, and what levels of mental detachment are achieved through it? Therefore, the aim of this paper is to give the reader a clearer answer and more critical analysis of cittaviveka, looking at different levels of mental detachment with special reference to the Mah\u0101-niddesa and the Pa\u1e6disambhid\u0101magga. The analysis revealed three main spiritual transformative processes: solitude through displacement (tada\u1e45gaviveka), the temporary suppression of obstacles, the state of absorptions or jh\u0101nas (vikkhambhanaviveka) and permanent uprooting of defilements (samucchedaviveka). The method adopted is a textual analysis of Therav\u0101da P\u0101li sources, including commentarial literatures and related works done by scholars were also incorporated to grasp the actual meaning of the selected term as clearly as possible.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nThis research analyses the value of Buddh\u0101nussati (recollection of the Buddha) in Therav\u0101da Buddhism, particularly its implications for soteriology, determining whether this form of meditation paves the way for attaining liberation (Nibb\u0101na) or merely serves as a preliminary devotion. Although Buddh\u0101nussati holds a prominent position among the forty meditation objects (kamma\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na) in classical Therav\u0101da works, the literature reveals significant divergence among scholars regarding its liberative potential. This study employs a hermeneutic and comparative method to analyze the P\u0101li canon, especially the A\u1e45guttara Nik\u0101ya and D\u012bgha Nik\u0101ya, as well as the commentaries, particularly Buddhaghosa\u2019s Visuddhimagga, to investigate the role of Buddh\u0101nussati in soteriology. It explores whether this practice can sufficiently generate the concentration (sam\u0101dhi) needed for jh\u0101nic absorption and the subsequent insight (vipassan\u0101), or if it merely reinforces faith (saddh\u0101) and ethical behaviour (s\u012bla), the means for more advanced practices. The research findings affirm Buddhism\u2019s soteriological teachings and the multiple functions of Buddh\u0101nussati, as it facilitates access to or \u2018stalking\u2019 concentration (upac\u0101ra sam\u0101dhi) and the \u2018growth\u2019 of wisdom through the contemplation of the Buddha\u2019s attributes. The findings affirm that Buddh\u0101nussati exhibits multiple soteriological functions beyond the oppositional claim based on practitioner ability, contextual use, and other composite practices. This research enriches modern Buddhist studies by resolving certain theoretical ambiguities and providing guidance for the teaching of meditation in contemporary Therav\u0101da Buddhist communities.\n\n.Keywords: Buddh\u0101nussati, Soteriological significance, Therav\u0101da Buddhism, Liberation (Nibb\u0101na), Samatha meditation, Vipassan\u0101 (insight), Kamma\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na (meditation objects), Jh\u0101na (meditative absorption), Faith (Saddh\u0101), P\u0101li Canon, Visuddhimagga, Devotional practice, Buddhist soteriology, Recollection meditation, Path to enlightenment.",

It begins by examining the types of noble ones and how they differ, to\u00a0focus on what is particular to the body-witness. This is their emphasis on sam\u0101dhi,\u00a0meditative concentration, rather than on faith or wisdom. They are seen to excel in\u00a0the four meditative absorptions known as jh\u0101nas, the four formless states, and the\u00a0cessation of perception and feeling. They experience these in a deeper way than the\u00a0freed-by-wisdom type of arahat (who can also experience these states to a degree),\u00a0but in a similar way to the freed-both-ways arahat. Analysis of relevant canonical passages show that jh\u0101nas and formless states can be experienced in a range of\u00a0depths and with different degrees of accompanying wisdom. Then, after examining\u00a0the nature of \u201cwitnessing\u201d in the suttas, the range of meanings of k\u0101ya is analysed:\u00a0the physical body, the tactile sense, a route of action, the body of mental states\u00a0other than consciousness, the sentient body that encompasses these and the physical body, and also all aspects of a person, all five khandhas. A key aspect of the jh\u0101nas\u00a0is that joy and happiness, then just happiness, then an equanimous mindful mind,\u00a0completely pervade the experienced, sensed body. Hence jh\u0101na very much involves\u00a0the body, in a positive way. The formless states which build on the jh\u0101nas, though,\u00a0are purely mental states, beyond any sense-impressions or ideas related to material\u00a0form. Here the mental body comes to the fore, yet in cessation mental states may\u00a0completely cease, leaving just a living physical body. So \u201cbody-witnessing\u201d works\u00a0in a range of ways but, for a body-witness then freed-both-ways person, in a very\u00a0deep way in which there is a direct mindful \u201ctouching\u201d of the states of sam\u0101dhi, so\u00a0as to be in close \u201ccontact\u201d with them. This also provides a basis for a further range of \u201cwitnessing\u201d in the \u201chigher knowledges\u201d in which the body and sensing are seen\u00a0to go far beyond their usual range.",

      "abstract": "Background Dual use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes is prevalent among US adults, increasing nicotine addiction and health risks. This study investigated what type of narrative messages would be more effective in encouraging individuals who use both e-cigarettes and cigarettes to quit both smoking and vaping. Methods We conducted an online between-subjects randomised experiment on individuals who currently use both e-cigarettes and cigarettes (n=489). The \u2018biomarker outcome\u2019 narrative group viewed a \u2018why-quit\u2019 message that highlighted a decrease in biomarkers of toxicant exposure on quitting smoking and vaping; the \u2018cessation experience\u2019 narrative group viewed a \u2018how-to-quit\u2019 message that highlighted strategies for quitting smoking and vaping. Multivariable regressions were conducted to evaluate message effects on motivation to quit smoking and vaping based on perceived importance, commitment and readiness (range: 0\u201310). Mediation analyses were performed to assess pathways from messages through emotional responses to motivation to quit. Results As compared with viewing the \u2018cessation experience\u2019 narrative, exposure to the \u2018biomarker outcome\u2019 narrative led to larger increases in the motivation to quit smoking (adjusted \u03b2 (SE)=0.3 (0.1), p=0.02) and vaping (adjusted \u03b2 (SE)=0.5 (0.1), p=0.003). Individuals who were exposed to the \u2018biomarker outcome\u2019 narrative reported higher negative emotions and lower positive emotions than those in the \u2018cessation experience\u2019 narrative group. The message effects on changes in motivation to quit smoking (\u03b2indirect effect=0.06, p=0.002) and vaping (\u03b2indirect effect=0.05, p=0.009) were significantly mediated by negative emotions, but not by positive emotions. Conclusion A biomarker outcome narrative message that highlights the efficacy of quitting smoking and vaping by presenting evidence-based, objective biomarkers of toxicant exposure may be a persuasive message format in anti-dual use messaging.",

Methods: A single-group pretest\u2013posttest study was conducted from April to June 2024 with 40 adolescent smokers from three high schools. The program consisted of weekly 50 min sessions over an 8-week period. Smoking dependence was measured using FTND and CDS-12, while mental health was assessed through PHQ-9 and GAD-7. Urine cotinine test was used as a biomarker. Results: The results showed significant improvements with moderate to large effect sizes in nicotine dependence (p = 0.033, d = 0.25), cigarette dependence (p = 0.034, d = 0.31), depression (p = 0.013, d = 0.37), and anxiety (p = 0.043, d = 0.40). Daily cigarette consumption decreased by an average of 2.57 cigarettes per day (p = 0.002, d = 0.52), with 15% of participants achieving complete smoking cessation and 42.5% showing reduced smoking behaviors. Conclusions: The results suggest that the END program was associated with reduced dependence and improved mental health outcomes among adolescent smokers. The positive memory reinforcement had a beneficial effect on mental health.",

      "abstract": "With an associated mortality of 8 million per year, the hazards of smoking make it one of the most concerning public health problems worldwide. To reduce the public health burden, smoking cessation programs have been implemented in various locations, including Taiwan. However, the experience of individuals receiving smoking cessation services remains poorly understood. In this study, we explored first-hand experience, feelings, and expectations of individuals who smoke cigarettes regarding smoking cessation services. The experiences of nine users of smoking cessation services in outpatient departments and pharmacies were qualitatively assessed with focus group interviewing. Six steps of content analysis were used to analyze the data, and member validation was performed to verify the rigor of data analysis. Two major themes were identified: \"negative experience from receiving poorly fitting services\" and \"expectations for better care in the future.\" Most participants experienced the alienation and mistrust from healthcare providers and expressed dissatisfaction with certain aspects of smoking cessation services, including cessation products, follow-up calls and check-up questionnaires, and smoking cessation education. Mental support with understanding from healthcare providers, more adaptable smoking cessation products and engaging follow-up, recommended approaches education, and loving support from peers, family, and friends are expected for future smoking cessation care. These results might guide policymakers and healthcare providers to improve smoking cessation effectiveness and implement individually tailored interventions.",

      "abstract": "Clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) is the gold standard for bladder management in patients with neurogenic bladder (NB). Although CIC remains the preferred method for bladder management in NB, long-term compliance is a complex, multifactorial issue. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate real-world CIC compliance, catheter preference, and reasons for discontinuation in a patient population initiated on CIC. We retrospectively reviewed 310 patients between March 2019 and May 2023. When starting CIC for the first time, we provide patients with three types of catheter samples. During follow-up, patients were interviewed about: current catheter preference, continuation or discontinuation of CIC, duration of CIC use prior to cessation, reasons for discontinuation, number and frequency of treated urinary tract infections (UTIs) during CIC use. Among the 310 new CIC patients (mean age: 72 years), 186 patients (60.0%) eventually discontinued CIC. Discontinuation was more frequent in males (122 cases, 66.0%), and the median duration of CIC use prior to cessation was 3.5 months. The most common reasons of CIC cessation were symptoms improvement, pain or discomfort during catheterization, recurrent UTI, declining general condition, and death due to unrelated causes. The CIC is a reliable method. Increasing the convenience of catheter use and reducing the rate of side effects are ways to improve adherence to this method, and hydrophilic-coated catheter products are most suitable for this purpose. And education of patients on catheterization technique and periodic follow-up is necessary to maintain patient compliance.",

      "abstract": "Tobacco smokers have increased hospital admissions and experience more health complications compared to those who do not smoke. As such, admission to hospital presents an opportunity for intervention. Nurses play a fundamental role in health promotion, and are well positioned to implement and deliver smoking cessation interventions, but barriers exist. The present study aimed to systematically identify barriers and facilitators experienced by nurses when undertaking two target behaviours; (1) discussing smoking with patients and (2) referring them to smoking cessation services. A convergent mixed methods study was conducted with secondary care nurses in a University Health Board in South Wales. Informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and the COM-B model of behaviour, data were collected using a self-administered anonymised survey and a series of focus groups and interviews that explored experiences of nurses and determinants of the target behaviours. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse survey responses and explore relationships between nurse characteristics and behavioural determinants. Deductive framework analysis was used to code qualitative data to TDF domains. Survey responses were received from 110 nurses working across 13 speciality areas. Nurse respondents perceived the target behaviours to be very important, and reported frequently undertaking the target behaviours. From the TDF, skills, social influences, environmental context and resources and reinforcement domains had the lowest scores, indicating greater perceived barriers in these areas. Twenty-one nurses participated in focus groups (n\u2009=\u20095) and interviews (n\u2009=\u20092). Factors influencing the target behaviours were identified for 10 of 14 TDF domains. Facilitators included seeing these behaviours as consistent with their role and utilising the presence of prompts in the environment, whilst barriers included lack of and inconsistent referral methods, competing priorities and patient resistance. Nurses recognise the importance of their role to discuss smoking but have limited knowledge of local smoking cessation services and experience barriers in their workspace. Reducing barriers to discussing smoking and referring patients will facilitate nurses to support their patients to achieve the best health outcomes through quitting smoking.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Individuals who smoke cigarettes and experience affective vulnerabilities report more severe smoking patterns. Prior work has identified several transdiagnostic risk factors associated with perceived barriers for smoking cessation, including distress tolerance, anxiety sensitivity, and emotion dysregulation. However, no work has explored the unique effect of these constructs on dimensions of perceived barriers for smoking cessation while controlling for the shared variance across these affective vulnerabilities. Objectives The present study aimed to investigate the effect of anxiety sensitivity, distress tolerance, and emotion dysregulation on perceived barriers for smoking cessation related to addiction, external, and internal domains when controlling for the shared variance across the identified affective vulnerabilities. Methods Participants included 154 adults who reported daily cigarette smoking and low distress tolerance (Mage = 29.6\u2009years; SD\u2009=\u20097.49; 31% female). Results Results indicate that higher anxiety sensitivity is related to greater external perceived barriers for smoking cessation whereas lower distress tolerance is related to greater internal and addiction perceived barriers for smoking cessation. Conclusion The current findings suggest anxiety sensitivity and distress tolerance are important to better understanding perceived barriers for smoking cessation in the context of one another and emotion dysregulation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Cigarette smoking is a leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality worldwide. Women who smoke face greater health risks than men, including higher rates of cardiovascular disease and more pronounced declines in lung function. Despite this, women experience lower success rates with conventional smoking cessation treatments, due in part to unique sex- and gender-related factors influencing smoking behavior and barriers to quitting. Digital health tools, such as mobile health apps, offer a promising avenue for delivering accessible, tailored smoking cessation support to women. Objective This study evaluated the acceptability and feasibility of the \u201cMy Change Plan\u2013Women\u201d (MCP-W) app, a gender-specific smoking cessation mobile health intervention co-designed with women who smoke, clinicians, and researchers, to address women\u2019s unique needs in smoking cessation. Methods We conducted a single-group, prospective, sequential mixed methods study with 30 women who smoke in Ontario, Canada. Participants used the MCP-W app for 28 days. Acceptability was defined as \u226550% of participants endorsing \u201cagree\u201d or \u201cstrongly agree\u201d to the statement \u201cusing the app is likely to help me make changes to my smoking habits.\u201d Feasibility was defined as \u226550% of participants using the app for 7 or more days during the trial period. Quantitative data on acceptability, smoking behavior, and motivation to quit were collected at baseline and follow-up via REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) surveys. App usage metrics were captured through Google Analytics. Semistructured interviews explored participants\u2019 experiences using the app and were thematically analyzed using the theoretical framework of acceptability. Results At follow-up, 37% (11/30; 95% CI 21%-56%) of participants rated the MCP-W app as acceptable, falling below the predefined threshold (\u226550%) and indicating that the intervention \u201cneeds further work.\u201d Feasibility criteria were met, with 60% (18/30) of participants using the app for 7 or more days. Notably, acceptability was higher among those who used the app for more than 14 days (7/11, 64%) compared with those with lower usage (4/19, 21%). Average daily cigarette consumption decreased from 16.4 to 14.6 cigarettes, and the number of participants reporting at least 1 smoke-free day in the previous week increased from 7% (2/27) to 22% (6/27). Qualitative findings revealed that women with higher motivation to quit found the app more helpful, particularly its behavior change tools (eg, cigarette tracking and identifying triggers) and gender-specific content. However, women facing stress, mental health challenges, or low readiness found it harder to engage. Participants suggested enhancements including customizable reminders, more interactive content, and live or artificial intelligence\u2013based emotional support. Conclusions The MCP-W app is a feasible intervention for delivering gender-specific smoking cessation support. However, its acceptability was limited to a third of users with high levels of motivation. Improvements to interactivity and support features may enhance its relevance and uptake among women with complex barriers to quitting.",

      "abstract": "In this study, a complete two-dimensional anatomical model of the rabbit heart was constructed by Zhang et al. The positive effects of external noise stimulation on cardiac pacemaking and conduction have been studied using computer simulations. Our results show that: 1) the slower pacemaking rate or even oscillation cessation, which is induced by the removal of Na i from the sinoatrial node or a decrease in the active sinoatrial node cell population, can be recovered by adding external noise. 2) Compared to the effect of Na i removal alone, the combined effect of Na i and cell death had a greater impact on slowing down the pacemaking rate. These phenomena indicate that external stimuli play an important role in controlling the initiation and conduction of sinoatrial node pacemaker activity, and that the aging heart may experience obstruction of sinus node conduction and even sudden cardiac death due to decreased cell membrane Na i or partial myocardial cell death. Our results provide insights into the intrinsic mechanisms underlying electroshock healing in some heart diseases.",

Data were collected between November 8 and December 20 2021. A total of 898 participants living in the Turkey aged 18\u2009years or older were recruited from Google online form panel. In general, it can be said that the higher the education level and the higher the income, the better the people adapt to the epidemic conditions. During the epidemic, it is seen that people generally (88.2%) get the news about the process from official sources. It is seen that the participants trust the ministry of health and the scientific committee at a rate of 67.1% in the epidemic management. It is possible that those who have chronic diseases and are addicted to cigarettes will experience the COVID-19 process more heavily. However, in this study, it could not be said that those who have a chronic disease and are addicted to smoking are more inclined to quit smoking.",

Low Socio Economic Status (SES) populations face greater barriers to quitting smoking that can be directly or indirectly linked to the experience of living in a low socioeconomic environment. This descriptive cross-sectional study aimed to assess the barriers to tobacco cessation in rural areas of the Ghaziabad district.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nA total of 250 participants were included in the sample. A pretested questionnaire was used to assess the demographic variables, tobacco use, and the barriers they face in tobacco cessation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe majority of the participants (45%) indulged in smokeless tobacco (chewers). Most participants had used tobacco for over 10-15 years (32.3%). The majority of the people did not know that tobacco cessation services existed in hospitals and dental offices (77.7%).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThere were many barriers to tobacco cessation in rural areas of the Ghaziabad district. Hence, concerted efforts and tailored strategies can help individuals in rural areas quit smoking.",

Perceived or real insufficient mothers\u2019 own milk (MOM) during the first 14 postpartum days is a frequently reported reason for early, unplanned lactation cessation. These first 14 postpartum days include the lactation phases of secretory activation (SA) and coming to volume (CTV; \u2265500 mL MOM daily) achievements and are affected by biological, behavioral, and economic factors. Methods: A framework for studying early, unplanned lactation cessation was developed by researchers with expertise in lactation science, neonatal research, healthy population research, public health, basic sciences, and economics. Results: Current research and clinical models primarily address behavioral factors, including maternal perceptions of insufficient MOM volume and social support from family or peers. While important, these models do not include biological and economic factors known to affect early, unplanned lactation cessation. The proposed integrated framework incorporates biological, behavioral, and economic factors with the centrality of mammary gland stimulation and MOM removal. Conclusion: This framework may be used to develop and test innovative research and clinical models and may especially be useful in addressing inequities among populations at higher risk for early, unplanned lactation cessation.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Oral smokeless tobacco (OST) is a major preventable risk factor for oral cancer. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), a commonly used pharmacological treatment in tobacco cessation interventions that help in reducing the withdrawal symptoms that individuals might experience in their attempt to quit. This systematic review aimed to assess NRT's effectiveness on OST cessation and reduction rates, addressing gaps in prior studies by incorporating recent research across diverse populations, including developing and developed countries. METHODS A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science. The inclusion criteria were: English articles (2004 to June 2024), OST users of both genders, NRT intervention, control group (generic, placebo, or no intervention), and a 7-day point prevalence of OST abstinence and reduction at week 12. Studies were excluded if they lacked relevant outcomes, were non-English, or published before 2004. Data abstraction forms were used to extract study characteristics and results. The Practical Meta-Analysis Effect Size Calculator determined the effect sizes and directions. The risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane Collaboration\u2019s tool. RESULTS Eleven studies were included with 40\u20131067 sample size. Seven were effective on OST abstinence, with effect sizes ranging from d=0.10 to d=0.54 and odds ratios from OR=1.67 to OR=4.10. One study demonstrated OST reduction (d=0.16 for dips/day and d=0.17 for cans/week). Nicotine dependence, NRT dosage, self-efficacy and social support were identified as key factors influencing the NRT\u2019s effectiveness in the included studies. CONCLUSIONS NRT can aid in OST cessation. Combination of NRT with other interventions such as coach calls and web-based interactive setting can enhance the OST abstinence rate. The evidence, though promising, is limited by study variability, and inconsistent outcome reporting. Future studies should explore self-efficacy, social support, and NRT dosage with larger sample sizes for better assessment.",

This study aims to evaluate the content and face validity of educational infographics to support e-cigarette cessation among youth e-cigarette users in Malaysia. This study employed a cross-sectional study design and involved experts and youth e-cigarette users. Upon the development, 17 experts specialising in smoking or e-cigarette cessation, with a mean age of 39.10 years and a mean years of experience of 12.24 years, were recruited for content validation. Meanwhile, for the face validation, 10 Malaysian youth e-cigarette users, with a mean age of 24.00, were purposively selected to assess the clarity of the infographics and provide feedback. Content validity indices (CVI) and face validity indices (FVI) were calculated for each topic, with thresholds of > 0.74 and 0.83 indicating acceptable content. The infographics demonstrated strong content and face validity, with average CVI of 0.98 (range: 0.94, 1.00; 95% CI: 0.95, 1.00) and average FVI of 0.96 (range: 0.70, 1.00; 95% CI: 0.87, 1.00), respectively. The infographics can be utilised to promote e-cigarette cessation after the trial and implementation phase, to assess their real-world effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Electronic nicotine delivery systems, electronic cigarettes, or vapes have been extensively marketed as a safer alternative to combustible cigarettes and as aids for smoking cessation. However, electronic cigarettes often deliver more potent forms of nicotine, such as nicotine salts and synthetic nicotine, which are masked by appealing aromas and flavors, thereby attracting nonsmoking children and adolescents. On the other hand, adults dependent on freebase nicotine (found in conventional cigarettes) often become addicted to these new forms of nicotine in electronic cigarettes. Dual use is common and poses significant health risks, potentially exceeding those of using either product alone. Dual users experience increased odds of COPD, lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, and stroke. Electronic cigarettes represent a new challenge for global public health and health professionals. There are currently no specific guidelines for vaping cessation treatment. This study sought to provide health professionals with a comprehensive vaping cessation approach, including effective strategies such as behavioral support, nicotine replacement therapy, and the use of nicotine-free medications.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Practicing smoking cessation counseling with real patients is often limited in pharmacy education. To address this gap, artificial intelligence (AI) was employed to simulate patient interactions for role-playing, providing a flexible and pressure-free learning experience. This study aimed to evaluate the use of an AI-simulated patient (ChatGPT) for smoking cessation counseling in pharmacy education by assessing students\u2019 satisfaction, perceived learning impact, benefits, and difficulties encountered. METHODS A quasi-experimental one-group post-test design was conducted with fourth-year pharmacy students enrolled in the smoking-cessation skills course at the Faculty of Pharmacy, Chiang Mai University, during the first semester of 2024 academic year. All students registered and attending the course were eligible and invited to participate. Case scenarios based on the 5As framework were developed and implemented in ChatGPT to simulate real-time counseling. After completing the AI session, students completed a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS Among 145 fourth-year pharmacy students, 66% reported satisfaction with the AI activity, and 84.4% indicated improved understanding of smoking cessation. Reported benefits included enhanced self-assessment and adaptability in the learning process, while common challenges involved technical limitations and limited understanding of how AI functions. CONCLUSIONS Overall, students expressed satisfaction with the AI-based activity, reported improved learning, and identified both benefits and areas for improvement. These findings support the integration of AI tools like ChatGPT as a student-centered, scalable approach in smoking cessation education, aligned with SDG 4: Quality Education.",

      "abstract": "People with HIV (PWH) are disproportionately affected by cigarette use, with a 40 \u2212\u200970% prevalence rate. Although many express a strong interest in quitting, many PWH who smoke experience lower cessation rates with traditional treatments, in part due to their comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms. Psilocybin, a classic psychedelic referred to as \u201cbreakthrough therapy\u201d by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA), has been shown to have potential as a therapeutic treatment for psychiatric symptoms, (e.g., anxiety and depression) and substance use disorders, including tobacco dependence. Preliminary evidence has shown that administering psilocybin to people who smoke and have been previously unable to quit with traditional treatments resulted in impressive smoking abstinence rates (80%) at 6-months in a smoking cessation pilot study. Explore, using qualitative methods, the perceptions and acceptability of a psilocybin-assisted treatment for smoking cessation among PWH who smoke. Semi-structured, in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with PWH who smoke. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using rapid thematic analysis. Twenty-five participants were enrolled: 15 cis male, 9 cis female, and 1 transgender female. Five main themes emerged: varying previous experiences with psilocybin; uncertainty about psilocybin\u2019s effects and concern over potential side effects; need for trusted sources of information and testimonials; ultimately willing to try psilocybin-aided therapy for tobacco treatment; and, set and setting of psilocybin use matters. Psilocybin-assisted smoking cessation treatment appears to be acceptable among PWH who smoke. Participants highlighted the importance of addressing key concerns related to an emerging therapy to increase acceptability and willingness to try it. Further research is needed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of psilocybin prior to incorporating this emerging therapy for smoking cessation into tobacco treatment clinical services for PWH.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objectives There are large and growing communities of Chinese, Vietnamese and Arab populations within many high-income countries, including Australia. These populations experience disproportionately higher rates of tobacco smoking. Cessation strategies are required that acknowledge the cultural factors shaping smoking behaviours. This review aimed to synthesise the evidence for smoking cessation interventions among Chinese, Vietnamese and Arab people, including outcomes and cultural considerations. Design Scoping review. Data sources We searched five electronic databases for peer-reviewed literature (CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, PubMed and Scopus). Relevant grey literature was sourced from research and health organisations, and community cultural organisations. Eligibility criteria English-language studies of tobacco cessation interventions with Chinese-speaking, Vietnamese-speaking or Arabic-speaking participants conducted in Australia, the USA, Canada, the UK or New Zealand between 2013 and 2025. Data extraction and synthesis Two reviewers independently screened for eligible studies and, if included, assessed risk of bias using Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. Results We identified 23 studies describing 15 intervention types, with written resources most highly featured. Promising category evidence was found for nine intervention types with Chinese people (written information, education sessions, visual information, counselling, involving others, providing nicotine replacement therapy, intervention branded merchandise, mobile messaging and telephone follow-up), as well as counselling with Arab people, and telephone follow-up with Vietnamese people. A variety of cultural considerations were addressed in the interventions, most commonly language barriers as well as the use of co-design and community participation. Conclusions Smoking cessation interventions with Chinese people were strongly supported, with less evidence for interventions with Vietnamese and Arabic people. Education-focused interventions were particularly effective, addressing low baseline knowledge underpinning smoking. Language barriers to smoking cessation were addressed through primary language supports. Further research is needed on effective smoking cessation intervention types with Arab and Vietnamese people.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hair pulling is a body-focused repetitive behavior frequently observed in individuals with autism and is increasingly conceptualized as a developmentally mediated self-regulatory behavior that may interfere with adaptive participation across everyday contexts. Although habit reversal training (HRT) has demonstrated efficacy for reducing repetitive behaviors, evidence supporting its implementation in naturalistic settings, particularly when integrated with sensory-regulation supports remains limited. METHODS: This study examined the effects of a sensory-integrated habit reversal (SI-HR) intervention on hair pulling and functional engagement in autistic children within a naturalistic educational context. A multiple-baseline across participants single-case experimental design was employed with eight autistic students (four boys, four girls) aged 8-14 years. Following staggered baseline phases, trained school personnel implemented a manualized intervention combining core HRT components (awareness training, competing responses, and stimulus control) with individualized sensory-regulation strategies embedded within daily routines. Hair pulling was measured using partial-interval recording, and engagement was assessed using momentary time sampling as an indicator of attentional regulation and adaptive participation. Treatment fidelity, interobserver agreement, and social validity were evaluated. RESULTS: Visual analysis and nonoverlap indices demonstrated consistent and immediate reductions in hair pulling across participants, with large effects (NAP range = 0.92-1.00) and maintenance of gains during a maintenance/probe phase. Functional engagement increased for most participants, although the magnitude of change varied. Teachers and caregivers rated the intervention as feasible and acceptable under typical educational conditions. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Findings provide preliminary support for a sensory-integrated behavioral approach to reducing body-focused repetitive behavior in autistic children, with associated improvements in functional engagement. These findings should be interpreted cautiously given the multicomponent nature of the intervention and the small sample size, underscoring the need for replication, component analyses, and extended follow-up across developmental and rehabilitative contexts.",

      "abstract": "This study examines the relationship between yoga practice and socioemotional functioning, comparing practitioners and non-practitioners across dimensions of emotional intelligence and social relationship patterns. Results indicate that yoga practitioners reported higher levels of emotion understanding and emotion control, but lower cognitive empathy and lower levels of support given to friends. A moderation analysis showed that yoga practice moderated the association between empathy and life satisfaction: empathy positively predicted life satisfaction in non-practitioners but not in regular practitioners. These associations suggest that greater intrapersonal emotional regulation among practitioners co-occurs with lower levels of interpersonal overinvolvement. As mindfulness was not measured, mechanistic interpretations remain tentative. These findings may have implications for interventions aimed at supporting emotional competencies and relational functioning, but causal claims require longitudinal investigation. The study contributes to understanding how yoga practice is associated with emotional and social functioning while proposing new directions for research on individualized effects of mind-body practices.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Veterinary professionals encounter myriad stressors that challenge their wellbeing and mental health. Positive psychology provides an evidence-based approach to improving mental health by emphasising individual strengths, effective coping mechanisms, and the promotion of overall wellbeing. The specific objectives of this narrative review were to: (1) provide an overview of positive psychology concepts applicable to the veterinary profession, (2) synthesise the growing body of literature on positive psychology concepts researched within the veterinary context while also providing insights from other healthcare professions, and (3) inform the integration of positive psychology concepts in education and/or daily veterinary practice of veterinarians. METHOD: This narrative review was conducted by examining peer-reviewed literature on positive psychology relevant to the veterinary profession. RESULTS: The review highlights the promising potential of positive psychology for veterinary professionals. For example, meaningful experiences such as helping clients and patients can foster veterinarian job satisfaction and mental wellbeing. Emotional intelligence, empathy, and compassion can enhance professional interactions and counteract negative mental health outcomes. Furthermore, practices such as mindfulness and flow have the potential to foster focus and emotional regulation, whereas self-esteem, self-efficacy and self-confidence contribute to a sense of competence and self-worth. LIMITATIONS: This review did not follow a systematic method for selecting and examining literature, and only includes peer-reviewed literature published in English. CONCLUSION: The evidence from this review provides encouraging possibilities to strengthen positive psychology skills applicable to veterinary professionals, bearing in mind that incorporating strategies for organisational wellbeing is equally important to promote a healthier and more sustainable veterinary field.",

Included studies from 2015 to 2025 evaluated mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), physical activity, peer support, and simulation-based training implemented in nursing curricula via workshops or wellness programs. RESULTS: Chronic stress disrupts dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and cortisol pathways, potentially impairing clinical reasoning and empathy. Interventions like mindfulness, CBT, and simulation training may reduce stress, enhance emotional regulation, and improve academic and clinical performance, potentially lowering burnout risk. CONCLUSION: Integrating these interventions into nursing curricula may foster resilient, competent nurses.
