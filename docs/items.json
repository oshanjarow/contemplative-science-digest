      "abstract": "Background: This scoping review investigates the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation in alleviating sleep disturbances among individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). With the rising prevalence of dementia and its profound impact on cognitive function and quality of life, this review aims to synthesize existing research and identify gaps in the literature. Methods: We systematically searched six electronic databases (CINAHL, Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Scopus) from 2004 to 2024, yielding 462 potentially relevant articles. Screening was conducted using ASReview, an AI ranking tool, which facilitated the selection of studies. Ultimately, seven studies that met our stringent eligibility criteria were included in the review. We adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines for reporting. Results: Our findings indicate that mindfulness meditation significantly improves sleep quality, reduces insomnia severity, and enhances overall well-being in this at-risk population. Notably, interventions that combine structured, face-to-face sessions with at-home practice emerged as the most effective. Conclusions: Despite these positive outcomes, methodological limitations, including small sample sizes and reliance on self-reported measures, underscore the need for more rigorous long-term studies. This review highlights the potential of mindfulness meditation as a low-cost, scalable intervention to improve sleep and cognitive health in older adults, paving the way for future research and clinical applications.",

      "abstract": "The experience of pain is a combined product of bottom-up and top-down influences mediated by attentional and emotional factors. Meditation states and traits are characterized by enhanced attention/emotion regulation and expanded self-awareness that can be expected to modify pain processing. The main objective of the present study was to explore the effects of long-term meditation on neural mechanisms of pain processing. EEG pain-related oscillations (PROs) were analysed in highly experienced practitioners and novices during a non-meditative resting state with respect to (a) local frequency-specific and temporal synchronizing characteristics to reflect mainly bottom-up mechanisms, (b) spatial synchronizing patterns to reflect the neural communication of noxious information, (c) pre-stimulus oscillations to reflect top-down mechanisms during pain expectancy, and (d) the P3b component of the pain-related potential to compare the emotional/cognitive reappraisal of pain events by expert and novice meditators. Main results demonstrated that in experienced (long-term) meditators as compared to non-experienced (short-term) meditators (1) the temporal and spatial synchronizations of multispectral (from theta-alpha to gamma) PROs were substantially suppressed at primary and secondary somatosensory regions contra-lateral to pain stimulation within 200 ms after noxious stimulus; (2) pre-stimulus alpha activity was significantly increased at the same regions, which predicted the suppressed synchronization of PROs in long-term meditators; (3) the decrease of the P3b component was non-significant. These novel observations provide evidence that even when subjected to pain outside of meditation, experienced meditators exhibit a pro-active top-down inhibition of somatosensory areas resulting in suppressed processing and communication of sensory information at early stages of painful input. The emotional/cognitive appraisal of pain is reduced but remains preserved revealing a capacity of experienced meditators to dissociate pro-active and reactive top-down processes during pain control.",

      "abstract": "The intricate world of human\u2013computer interaction deeply explores how people gain knowledge and blend technology into daily life. Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of several methods for measuring brain activity, it is non-invasive, portable, inexpensive and time-sensitive. Research shows a strong link between meditation and changes in EEG patterns, spanning various techniques. With machine learning playing a major role, EEG datasets have made comprehensive study possible. This paper investigates the efficacy of 1D-CNN (One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network) classification, using complexity, continuity and connectivity features. It remarkably outperforms and achieves 60% training accuracy, showcasing model robustness in meditation classification. This novel methodology enables to differentiates neural oscillations in type of meditator and control. Prior research used power spectrum density, entropy, and connectivity for meditation distinctions. EEG data from practitioners of Himalayan Yoga (HYT), Isha Shoonya (SYN) and Vipassana (VIP) as well as untrained controls (CTR) are examined in this research. Employing chi-square, CNN and hyperparameter models, outcomes reveal distinctive cognitive aspects among meditation styles, allowing effective differentiation.",

      "abstract": "This study aims to examine Anthony de Mello\u2019s Sadhana practice from a religious\u2013psychological perspective, applying Carl Gustav Jung\u2019s analytical psychology and views on the Spiritual Exercises. The analysis reveals that Sadhana, which integrates psychotherapeutic methods such as Gestalt therapy and the methodology of Vipassana meditation, holds significant implications. First, based on Jung\u2019s theory, Sadhana pursues wholeness through the union of opposites, such as extraversion and introversion. Jung posited that opposing elements coexist within the human psyche, and their harmonization is central to individuation. Thus, practices that integrate these opposites are meaningful attempts to foster inner growth and maturity. Second, by incorporating Gestalt therapy into the Spiritual Exercises, Sadhana enhances awareness and employs methods to address contact boundary disturbances, enabling self-reflection and restoration of one\u2019s relationship with God. Anthony de Mello\u2019s Sadhana practice is evaluated as a novel case that presents new possibilities for contemporary Christian spirituality.",

      "abstract": "This study examines the systematic development and philosophical \u201cfinalization\u201d of \u015bamatha (\u6b62 tranquility) and vipa\u015byan\u0101 (\u89c0 insight) within the foundational texts of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra tradition. Central to the transmission of Buddhism to East Asia was the categorization of practice (\u4fee\u884c cary\u0101) through the lenses of concentration (\u4e09\u6469\u5730 sam\u0101dhi) and wisdom (\u822c\u82e5 praj\u00f1\u0101). This paper focuses on two pivotal canons: the \u015ar\u0101vakabh\u016bmi \u8072\u805e\u5730 section of the Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi-\u015b\u0101stra \u745c\u4f3d\u5e2b\u5730\u8ad6 and the Sa\u1e43dhinirmocana-s\u016btra \u89e3\u6df1\u5bc6\u7d93. In the \u015ar\u0101vakabh\u016bmi, \u015aamatha is presented as a rigorous, self-contained psychological system. The text outlines a cognitive progression from \u201cworldly common paths\u201d\u2014including impurities meditation (\u4e0d\u6de8\u89c0 a\u015bubhabh\u0101van\u0101) and the eight liberations (\u516b\u89e3\u812b a\u1e63\u1e6dau vimok\u1e63\u0101\u1e25)\u2014to the sophisticated \u201cnine stages of mental abiding\u201d (\u4e5d\u4f4f\u5fc3 nav\u0101k\u0101r\u0101 citta-sthiti\u1e25). This research analyzes the psychological mechanisms of these stages, illustrating how they facilitate a metacognitive transition from distraction (\u6563\u4e82 vik\u1e63epa) to absorption (\u79aa\u90a3 dhy\u0101na), culminating in the eradication of afflictions (\u7169\u60f1 kle\u015ba). Furthermore, the paper explores how the Sa\u1e43dhinirmocana-s\u016btra provides the ultimate philosophical synthesis of these practices. By framing \u015bamatha and vipa\u015byan\u0101 within the Consciousness-Only (\u552f\u8b58 vij\u00f1aptim\u0101trat\u0101) framework, the s\u016btra finalizes the meaning of Adhicitta-\u015bik\u1e63\u0101 (\u589e\u4e0a\u5fc3\u5b78 training in higher mind). By bridging the technical rigor of the \u015ar\u0101vakabh\u016bmi with the Mah\u0101y\u0101na ontological depth of the Sa\u1e43dhinirmocana-s\u016btra, this study clarifies the evolution of buddhist bh\u0101van\u0101.",

      "abstract": "This study examines the social and religious roles of a Manggal\u012ba within the Buddhist community, with a case study in Dusun Ngadisari, Tempuran Village, Kaloran District, Temanggung Regency, Central Java. The Manggal\u012ba is a local religious figure who serves as both an elder and leader of the community in various religious rituals such as weddings, funerals, patid\u0101na, and traditional ceremonies including gendurenan, nyadran kubur, and village selametan. In Buddhist communities without a pandita, the Manggal\u012ba plays a central role as a spiritual guide and preserver of local traditions. This research employs a qualitative descriptive approach using observation, in-depth interviews, and documentation methods. The selection of a Manggal\u012ba is conducted through communal deliberation, based on spiritual and ritual competence, particularly in the aspects of s\u012bla, sam\u0101dhi, and pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101. The findings show that the Manggal\u012ba in Dusun Ngadisari fulfills his role with great dedication, both in guiding the community's spiritual life and participating in social matters such as conflict mediation, community empowerment, and maintaining social harmony among villagers.",

      "abstract": "Abstract:This article examines two accounts of how Buddhist meditative practice has been seen as cultivating non-conceptual mental states. The first, exemplified in recent work by Evan Thompson, drawing on Dharmak\u012brti, views the representational contents of certain meditative states as non-conceptual. The second, found in Yog\u0101c\u0101ra texts like the Mah\u0101y\u0101nasa\u1e43graha, suggests that meditation cultivates a type of awareness that is non-conceptual (nirvikalpaj\u00f1\u0101na). I argue that while there are strong epistemological and phenomenological arguments against any representational contents being non-conceptual, the view that awareness itself is non-conceptual can avoid these problems. Non-conceptual awareness is best understood, I suggest, as having a reflexive structure akin to later notions of selfawareness (svasa\u1e43vedana), which simultaneously establishes it as non-conceptual and vouchsafes it against the challenges facing non-conceptual content accounts. I thus offer a preliminary defense of the view that certain meditative practices cultivate an awareness in which the reflexive, non-conceptual nature of consciousness is revealed.",

      "abstract": "This dissertation explores the role of meditative sound in film and its influence on emotional guidance and audience immersion. In contemporary film sound design, meditative sounds subtly evoke introspection, calm, and deep emotional resonance, yet their narrative significance is often overlooked. By analysing three distinct films - Nomadland, Arrival, and Her - this study examines how different auditory environments, from natural landscapes and silent cosmic expanses to futuristic electronic soundscapes, shape the perceptions and emotional responses of viewers. Employing psychoacoustic analysis, the research focuses on features such as low-frequency sound waves, rhythmic repetition, ASMR-like auditory triggers, and the strategic use of silence. The findings reveal that meditative sound design creates emotional balance, fosters psychological intimacy, and enhances immersion by constructing sonic spaces that guide audiences into states of relaxation, introspection, and emotional openness. These techniques significantly impact narrative engagement and emotional experience. The dissertation concludes that meditative sounds are intentional, integral elements of cinematic storytelling, offering filmmakers subtle yet powerful tools to shape audience emotions and perceptions. It also encourages further exploration into the integration of psychoacoustic principles within sound design practice.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Depression is prevalent among colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors. Although various physical activity intensities are differentially associated with depressive symptoms, the underlying mediator and moderator involving interoception and mindfulness, remain unclear. This study aims to examine whether interoceptive accuracy differentially mediates the relationship between various physical activity intensities and depressive symptoms and whether mindfulness moderates these pathways. METHODS: In this multicenter cross-sectional study, 395 CRC survivors completed validated questionnaires assessing depressive symptoms, physical activity\u00a0participation, interoceptive accuracy, and mindfulness. Mediation and moderated mediation analyses via PROCESS version 4.1 for SPSS tested whether interoceptive accuracy mediated associations between light and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (LPA vs. MVPA) and depressive symptoms, and whether mindfulness moderated these pathways. RESULTS: Both LPA and MVPA are negatively associated with depressive symptoms (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Interoceptive accuracy significantly mediated these associations, accounting for 49.09% of the total effect for LPA and 20.56% for MVPA. Mindfulness moderated the LPA-interoceptive accuracy (B\u2009=\u2009-0.004, p\u2009=\u20090.031), interoceptive accuracy-depression (B\u2009=\u2009-0.022, p\u2009=\u20090.004), and MVPA-depression pathways (B\u2009=\u2009-0.001, p\u2009=\u20090.034), suggesting differential, intensity-dependent associations. CONCLUSIONS: LPA showed negative associations with depressive symptoms, with interoceptive accuracy fully mediating this association. In contrast, MVPA demonstrated both direct and indirect associations with depressive symptoms, partially mediated by interoceptive accuracy. Mindfulness strengthened these relationships through complementary and synergistic moderation, highlighting the dynamic interaction between bodily awareness and physical activity in psychological recovery. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Tailoring gentle, mindful movement to enhance interoception may offer a feasible, integrative rehabilitation strategy to reduce depression among CRC survivors.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This systematic review aimed to examine how mindfulness approaches affect pain, symptom cluster severity, and quality of life among adolescents receiving cancer chemotherapy. Contrasting with prior syntheses emphasizing adult populations or isolated symptoms, this investigation specifically targets symptom clusters in adolescent cancer patients (aged 10-19 years), a unique population requiring specialized nursing care approaches given their distinct developmental characteristics. METHODS: A comprehensive literature evaluation was conducted across Scopus, Cochrane Embase, PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCOhost), and ProQuest databases for publications in English and Thai from 2014 to 2024. Independent researchers conducted quality evaluation using established JBI appraisal tools. Information was synthesized through quantitative analysis employing random-effects modeling to address methodological heterogeneity between controlled and uncontrolled investigations. RESULTS: From 299 identified publications, three investigations (n = 141) satisfied inclusion requirements. Participants received individualized mindfulness-based yoga protocols incorporating breathing techniques, physical movements, and relaxation practices. Analysis revealed predominantly nonsignificant outcomes across symptom measures. Uncontrolled studies demonstrated considerable heterogeneity for pain (I\u00b2 = 84%) and sleep (I\u00b2 = 86%) with no overall meaningful effects. The randomized trial showed no significant between-group differences for symptom measures. Uncontrolled studies indicated modest enhancement in cancer-specific quality of life aspects (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.55, p = .05); however, controlled comparison revealed no significant between-group changes for quality of life indicators. Evidence confidence was rated as low to extremely low across all measures due to high heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: This first systematic synthesis of MBIs for adolescent cancer populations identifies limited current efficacy but reveals critical evidence gaps. Findings highlight the need for rigorous, age-appropriate, nursing-led interventions that integrate mindfulness with other evidence-based strategies to address multidimensional symptom clusters in pediatric oncology care. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Pain management nurses play an integral role in advancing nonpharmacological approaches to symptom management for adolescents with cancer. Mindfulness-based interventions may have potential to enhance holistic care and support patients and families in coping with treatment-related symptoms; however, the current evidence base remains limited and of variable quality. Accordingly, these interventions should be interpreted with caution, and additional rigorous, nursing-led research is warranted to determine their efficacy, feasibility, and sustainability in pediatric oncology practice.

Data were collected from 398 construction workers from 15 project teams in China. The results showed that organisational mindfulness significantly and positively predicted safety behavior, situational awareness and harmonious safety passion played a parallel mediating role in this relationship.
