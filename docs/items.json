      "abstract": "The study aimed to investigate the pre-to-post effects of mindfulness training on school teachers\u2019 psychological and professional well-being, as well as to explore the moderating role of temperament and character on these effects. An 8-week mindfulness-based intervention was delivered via internet-based group meetings to Italian teachers (n =\u2009139), who were assessed within two weeks before and after the intervention with self-report measures of emotional distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), interoceptive awareness (Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness), and professional efficacy (Teachers\u2019 Sense of Efficacy Scale), as well as with the Temperament and Character Inventory. A control group of teachers (n =\u200947) was tested with the same measures in two temporally-matched sessions. Analysis of variance showed positive intervention effects on anxiety (medium effect size), on six of the eight dimensions of interoceptive awareness (medium-to-large effect size) and on two of the three scales of professional efficacy (small-to-medium effect size). Moderation analysis identified the following effects of temperament and character on outcomes: (1) reduced anxiety only for higher baseline reward dependence, or lower-to-middle baseline self-directedness; (2) improved interoceptive attention regulation specifically for middle-to-higher baseline persistence; (3) improved teacher efficacy for student engagement only for lower baseline self-transcendence. The study shows the positive effects of mindfulness training on teachers' psychological and professional well-being. It also highlights the importance of considering the impact of temperament and character dimensions on these effects, for example for developing effective mindfulness-based interventions for teachers. Future research should explore potential mechanisms of action underlying the observed effects and evaluate them in the long term. This study is not preregistered.",

Methods : A cross-sectional study was conducted with 299 elite male football players from Turkish football leagues. Data were collected using the Mindfulness Inventory for Sport, Emotions Inventory for Sport, and Challenge and Threat Scale. The data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Results : The results revealed a positive correlation between threat appraisal and negative emotions, indicating that higher threat appraisal is associated with increased negative emotions. Mindfulness was found to have a negative relationship with both threat appraisal and negative emotions. Additionally, mindfulness was found to mitigate the relationship between threat appraisal and negative emotions, suggesting that mindfulness can help manage the emotional impact of threat appraisal. Conclusions : These findings imply that athletes\u2019 emotional states can be better regulated in high-pressure situations through mindfulness. The study provides practical implications for athletes and coaches, and emphasizes the need for further longitudinal and experimental research to explore the effects of threat appraisal and mindfulness in greater detail",

      "abstract": "Background Integrating mindfulness practices and Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) into teacher education can significantly enhance educators\u2019 wellbeing, resilience, and effectiveness. However, the cultural specificity of such interventions, particularly in the Chinese educational context, requires careful adaptation and examination. Objective This study aims to design, implement, and evaluate a culturally adapted MBSEL curriculum for Chinese pre-service teachers. It investigates the program\u2019s effectiveness in improving mindfulness, self-compassion, and life satisfaction, contributing to the literature on integrating mindfulness and SEL in teacher education within a specific cultural setting. Methods Employing a quasi-experimental design, the study involved a sample of 41 Chinese pre-service teachers divided into an experimental group (n =\u202f22) and a control group (n =\u202f19). The MBSEL program\u2019s impact on participants\u2019 mindfulness, self-compassion, and life satisfaction was assessed using pre- and post-intervention measures. Results The results of repeated measures analyses of variance indicated significant improvements in mindfulness, self-compassion, and life satisfaction among participants in the experimental group compared to the control group. These outcomes underscore the effectiveness of the culturally adapted MBSEL program in enhancing key aspects of pre-service teachers\u2019 wellbeing and professional readiness. Discussion The study demonstrates that a culturally adapted MBSEL curriculum effectively enhances mindfulness, self-compassion, and life satisfaction among Chinese pre-service teachers. This emphasizes the necessity of cultural sensitivity in developing mindfulness and SEL interventions for teacher education. Moreover, the success of the MBSEL program suggests its potential for global integration, urging policymakers and educators to prioritize culturally tailored approaches to enhance teacher wellbeing and educational outcomes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe Altered States of Consciousness Scale (3/5D-ASC or 11-ASC) is widely used to assess non-ordinary states of consciousness, particularly for psychedelic research. However, its original dimensional model (3D-ASC within 5D-ASC) and later 11-subscale structure (11-ASC) have a hierarchically incompatible higher/lower-order structure. Although the 11-ASC offers superior model fit, the 3D-ASC remains widely used for summarizing broader experiential domains.\n\n\nAIMS\nWe wanted to provide an updated, psychometrically revalidated version of the ASC. We tested whether the 42-item 11-ASC could be integrated into a coherent three-dimensional framework. We further hypothesized that this revised model would outperform the original 66-item 3D-ASC while preserving its conceptual clarity.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData from 901 5D-ASC questionnaires from 398 healthy participants across 16 randomized, mostly placebo-controlled psychedelic (lysergic acid diethylamide, psilocybin, mescaline, and N,N-dimethyltryptamine) studies were split for exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. We compared the 3D-ASC and 11-ASC in terms of reliability and model fit, and tested whether the 11-ASC could be summarized within a three-dimensional model.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTen of the 11 subscales formed three higher-order dimensions-Positive (PosE), Distressing (DisE), and Perceptual (PerE) effects-mirroring the 3D-ASC but with improved fit. We propose this as the 3D-ASCr scale. The Anxiety subscale could not be integrated due to consistent floor effects (low anxiety in the sample), but given its clinical relevance, it is retained within 3D-ASCr (as part of DisE or a standalone subscale).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe 3D-ASCr is an updated version of the ASC and is recommended for use with classic serotonergic psychedelics in both clinical practice and research.",

      "abstract": "Abstract \nIn the Buddhist conceptualization of tanh\u0101 (a form of craving), it is seen as the main reason for suffering, the undermining of morals, and instability in existence. The goal of tanh\u0101-nirodha (the cessation of craving) is Buddhist soteriology, but the goal is not limited to monastic practices and touches on many aspects of modern ethics, psychology, and social issues. In this paper, tanh\u0101 and the cessation of suffering will be examined jointly and inter-disciplined through the Buddhist philosophical tools of the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, integrating moral psychology, contemplative science, and cognitive neuroscience. The paper examines deeply-rooted craving in the socio-cultural system through the unconditioned process of perception, appraisal, affective reactivity, and cognitive bias, and identity construction. The study aims to identify craving as not simply an individual issue, but as a deeply interlaced issue in both the social and cultural structures as well as the individual.\nThis article attempts to show how the Eightfold Path works systematically to deconstruct the dissatisfaction in life through ethical change, cognitive restructuring, and attention retraining, using P\u0101li canonical sources and contemporary empirical studies of attention. emotion regulation, reinforcement learning, and behavioral conditioning. The article further explores how Buddhist dissatisfaction relates to contemporary global concerns such as digital addiction, consumptive desire, environmental degradation and, polarized identity politics. The article seeks to enhance the field of Buddhist studies in the modern world by offering a detailed and complex system for the cessation of desire, to show the relevance of Buddhist wisdom in contemporary life.\nKeywords: craving; tanh\u0101; cessation; Four Noble Truths; Eightfold Path; Buddhist ethics; moral psychology; cognitive science; mindfulness.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\nModern legal systems worldwide are increasingly faced with a perceived crisis of legitimacy and effectiveness. Critics point to its all-encompassing punitiveness, procedural detachment, and lack of engagement with the causes of social and ecological misery. This study argues for a reconsideration of Buddhist philosophy, often neglected in the category of personal ethics, as a rich and, surprisingly, marketable theory of law. The analysis goes beyond a comparative study and establishes a coherent theory of Buddhist Jurisprudence by aligning core doctrinal propositions with the functional implications of modern secular law.\n Analysis begins to uncover the jurisprudential potential in Buddhist foundational teachings. It suggests the Four Noble Truths as a diagnostic and prescriptive model for a legal system, and it theorizes law as not an instrument of sovereign fiat, but as a force for the end of systemic suffering (dukkha-nirodha). The central teachings of interdependence (pa\u1e6dicca-samupp\u0101da) and non-self (anatt\u0101) are scrutinized solely to reframe ideas of legal responsibility, personhood, and rights. Moreover, the early monastic law of the Vinaya is investigated not simply as an interesting historical tidbit but as a subtle proto-legal system, critiquing its focus on intent, due process, and reparation.\n Based on this theoretical foundation, the study establishes a hybrid legal model. It examines in some depth how a Dhamma approach would transform core areas, such as penal theory, where physical rehabilitation and moral rehabilitation are more critical than punishment; the law of obligations, basing tort and contract in relation-based responsibility and right livelihood; and environmental law, basing a rigorous egocentric jurisprudence on the law of interdependence. The final part addresses the challenges of practical implementation, examining possibilities for incorporating these values through experiments in restorative justice, legislative \u201cDhamma impact assessments,\u201d and redesigned legal education, apparently adeptly balancing a transformative vision with political pragmatism. Finally, Buddhist Jurisprudence presents a critical and timely model, one that envisions a legal system capable of promoting collective flourishing through compassion, wisdom, and a steadfast commitment to repairing harm.",

      "abstract": "Hermann Hesse\u2019s Siddhartha (1951) is a profound literary exploration of human suffering and the quest for spiritual fulfillment. Rooted in Buddhist philosophy, the novel dramatizes the journey from ignorance and desire to wisdom and enlightenment. This study examines the novel through the lens of the Four Noble Truths: Dukkha (suffering), Samudaya (the cause of suffering), Nirodha (the cessation of suffering), and Magga (the path to liberation)\u2014as articulated in canonical Buddhist texts such as the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta. The research demonstrates how Hesse preserves the essence of Buddhist doctrine while transforming it for a Western audience, emphasizing individual experience, existential reflection, and personal intuition. Close textual analysis of Siddhartha\u2019s encounters with the Samanas, his life with Kamala, and his awakening by the river with Vasudeva reveals both adherence to and divergence from traditional Buddhist principles. This study further explores how the novel reflects the tensions of Western modernity, including alienation and individualism, and how these elements reshape the Four Noble Truths in Hesse\u2019s literary vision. Ultimately, the article argues that Siddhartha serves as a bridge between Eastern spirituality and Western existential thought, offering a universal meditation on suffering, desire, and liberation.",

Prior treatments included surgery (44%), radiotherapy (22%), and one exenteration. Tumour origin was conjunctival (56%), cutaneous (33%), or unknown (11%). 8 (89%) showed orbital invasion, including 2 with intracranial spread. Cemiplimab was indicated when surgery was refused or as palliative treatment in cases not amenable to localized treatment. Mean cemiplimab duration was 12.3\u2009months (range 2.1-36.4). Immune-related adverse events included grade 2\u00a0hypothyroidism (n\u2009=\u20092, continued therapy) and grade 2\u00a0hepatitis (n\u2009=\u20091, discontinued). Complete and partial responses were seen in 22% and 33%, respectively; 44% progressed. No significant difference in response was observed between conjunctival and cutaneous SCC (p\u2009=\u20091.00). 2 patients (22%) underwent exenteration after starting treatment. Average total follow-up was 50.8\u2009months (range 17.4-130.6). One recurrence occurred 12\u2009months after treatment cessation; no new metastases were reported during follow-up. Two patients died from unrelated causes.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTo our knowledge, this is the largest single case series of cemiplimab used in conjunctival SCC. Our results underscore the potential of cemiplimab as globe-sparing and vision-preserving treatment in advanced periocular conjunctival and cutaneous SCC, including more aggressive and complex cases with intracranial involvement or perineural spread, both as primary treatment and after previous surgery in recurrent cases.",

This redefinition, grounded in a nationally recognized vocational standard, provides a clear framework for professionalization, mitigating architectural friction and\naligning global industry expectations with the strategic value of an FSD possessing both deep implementation empathy and\ncrucial architectural oversight.",

      "abstract": "The unforgiving pace and complexity in today\u2019s life is greatly challenging our ability to live healthier and fully in the present era. Today the world we live is full of competition and frustration to achieve the desired, leading to emotional stress and strain which adversely affects our physical, mental, social and spiritual health too. As per Acharya Charaka, Chinta (stress) and Ati-Chintanam (overthinking) are the causes of Rasovaha Srotodushti which ultimately become the aetiological factor for many of the diseases. Prolonged or inadequate response to stressors can impair the growth and development of the human body resulting in endocrine, metabolic, autoimmune, and psychological disorders. Number of research shows that untreated chronic stress results in serious health conditions, while finding positive and healthy means to manage it, may reduce the risks. In Ayurveda along with Panchakarma techniques like Shirodhara, Abhyanga etc., Medhya Rasayanas like Shankhpushpi, Brahmi etc., Satvavjaya Chikitsa plays an important role in the management of many mental ailments including stress. The word Satvavjaya constitutes of two words Satva meaning consciousness or mind and Avjaya meaning to conquer or win over. It aims to control mind (Manonigraha) and to restrain it from unwholesome thoughts or perceptions (Ahita Arthas). It is a unique non pharmacological treatment modality which adopts a comprehensive psychosomatic-spiritual approach to maintain the normalcy of mental health. Among all available techniques prevailing for control over mind, yoga offers one of the best methods as it stresses over Chittavritti Nirodha (control of mind from stressful thoughts).",

That there is suffering in this universe is a fact of common experience. Poverty, dwsesa, meanness, old age, hatred, greed, conflicts are fraught in this world. Human Life is full of suffering no one can deny to it.\n2. There is a Cause of Suffering (duhkha samudaya):\nEverything is a cause and Nothing comes out of nothing ex nihilo nihil fit. The existence of whole event depends on its condition and causes. According to Buddhism, in this world everything is relative, limited and conditional. Every suffering is a fact; it must have a cause and it arises from some conditions. 'This being, that arise', 'the cause being present, the effect arises', is causal law of dependent origination.\n3. There is a Cessation of Suffering (duhkha nirodha) \n Everything originates from some causes and conditions, hence if we are these conditions and causes are removed the effect must also cease. The cause being is removed, the effect causes is to be exist. We are known everything being is conditional and relative is necessarily momentary and what momentary must be decay. If I am born then I am must be die. Every production implies destruction.\n4. There is a Way of Leading to this Cessation of Suffering (duhka nirodha gamini pratipat)\n This is an ethical and spiritual pathway by following which suffering may be removed and liberation attained. It is the Noble Eight-fold Path: The Noble Eight-Fold Pathway consists of eight steps which are: Right faith (samyag drsti), Right resolve (sankalpa), 3 Right speech (vak), Right Action (karmanta), Right living (ajiva), Right effort (vyayama), Right thought (smrti), Right concentration (samadhi). In the old books we also perceive the mention of a three-pathway consisting of Shila or Right conduct, Samadhi or right concentration and Prajna or right knowledge. They also called to Darshana, Jnana and Charitra of Jainism. This triple pathway is lead to direct cause of liberation.\n The fourth noble Truth established down that there is a pathway (marga) which is Buddha obey and others can alike follow to obtain a state liberate from suffering. Clues considering this pathway are acquired from the knowledge important conditions that cause suffering. The pathway illustrates by Buddha's conduct of eight steps and accordingly called the eightfold noble pathway (astangika marag). Hinayana alike Jainism, is a belief God, Karma introduction the assign of God. Believe on the opinion of Buddha: 'be a Light unto thyself (atmadipo bhava), and Buddha's last opinion: 'and now brethren I catch my decline of you: whole the Constituents of being are momentary; Solve your salvation with Diligence'. Hinayana's seriousness liberation for and by, the personal himself. It is the illiberal path of self-help. Its aim is Arhathod or the expressed of the spiritual believer who acquired personal salvation, Nibbana, which is view as the annihilation of suffering. Mahayana school is also known for his great vehicle and Hinayana is known for his small vehicle. The purpose of liberation in Hinayana is said to be unreal and egoist. Mahayana trusts that Nirvana is not a negative in action of suffering but a unconditional state of bliss. Its moral believer is Bodhisattva who put off his own salvation in order to appearance for the salvation of others. Buddhism is here change into Divinity and an adore such. Buddhism is identified with superior reality and is said to occupy the ability of reincarnation. The Buddha is the certain self prevalent through whole the so-called personal selves. Buddha is the nominal following all phenomena. \n The Buddisattva is he who reaches absolute wisdom, always stay in it, and inspired by the love of all beings everlasting works for their salvation which is to be acquire here in this universe. The Mahayana is willing to permit reality so that eager Buddha is may liberate others. The word is 'Liberated' is moderate from term 'Liberates' means 'to release or to set free' someone from the sensation or state that create his vitality sorrowful or hard. Conditions of liberation is that create one's life painful, hence the case of Independence or free from servitude, bondage, serfdom, need, and separately other makes suffering, whereas the feelings of the liberation are that create one's life sorrowful is the state of liberation is from inner fight or difficulty one's own mind or thinking. A religion of misery necessarily known by Buddhism. Buddha did not assert to be an adept metaphysics and he did not claim to device substantial solutions of the most terrible metaphysical problems. Buddha had to philosophies in so distant as he was concerned with finding of the ways of destruction of suffering and sorrow in human life. Buddha did not seek knowledge and truth for their own sake but knowledge was a means of obtaining complete freedom from suffering and misery according to the Buddha. The most important thing that occupied his mind forever was the existence of evil and sorrow in life and he most seriously used himself to discover the ways leading to the final cessation of sorrow. The ultimate end that he always views, was Nirvana which means the total abolition of sorrow and destruction of all consciousness. All the epistemological, ontologically, and metaphysical seeks of Buddhism were conducive to the primary end of them, which enjoyment of perfection of life in the form of Nirvana. Buddha's goal of life was not to manifest truth but to aid men to free themselves from the all-diffuse sorrow and pain of life. It is essential to deeply understand the nature of sorrow. Buddhism believes in the universal transient of things. It is possible to infer the evanescence of things as the cause of sorrow. Thus, Misery is another term for transiency of life. Every human experience is only a passing view of human life and possesses only a limited period. The duration of the lives of things may vary but nothing stays forever. As every experience complete after a very short period, one loses the happiness with the resultant result of despair, which fills the mind with misery. Thus, Life becomes a continuous sequence of moments of despair and sorrow. The Buddhist concept of Nirvana (Nibbana) is equal to that of moksa in the other systems. The necessary nature of Nibbana consists in one's becoming perfectly from every kind of desire. Nibbana or Nirvana is a state of entire desire lessness.\n Nirvana thus means eternal freedom from all kinds of devotion which are generated by desires. All sorrows are root cause from Desires. According to the sorrow is caused by ignorance. Ignorance is the cause of all desire, madness and all the sorrow of the universe. It is said in the Buddhist Mahayana texts-- \"The idea of ignorance is what gives root to the huge poison tree of mundana existence with its trunk of pain.\" He accepted at fact that nearly in all Indian philosophical opinion knowledge has been viewed as the ultimate means of the obtaining of salvation. He writes--\" The center point of Indian salvation theories was \"knowledge\", by which man acquires the power to cessation misery and to lead empiric reality back to its origin.\" True knowledge of the causes of sorrow leads to the cessation of sorrows. As man's bondage is a creation of his mind and is based on knowledge, the Buddhist importantly argument that liberation can be obtained by power knowledge which brings to an end ignorance and illusion.\n According to Buddhism most importantly maintains that to obtain the joy of Nirvana we must radically separate this illusion, this ignorance, this origin of all evil and suffering in this life. Ignorance of Avidya according to Buddhism is a positive entity. It is the innate tendency of the mind, the subconscious influences and drives (vasanas) which make the mind hold to false ideas and notions. Thus, ignorance acts as the primary cause of all Klesas and their resultant sorrow. The Buddhists give a long causal series of misery. Commonly called the twelve Nidanas or Pratyasamutpada, that is to say chain of Dependence. (1) There is Ignorance (Avidya) in the beginning (2) after ignorance comes Action (3) after action comes consciousness (4) after consciousness comes Name and form (5) after name and form comes six organs (6) after six organs comes touch (7) after touch comes sensation vedana (8) after Sensation comes desire (9) after desire comes clinging (10) after clinging comes being (11) after being comes birth (12) after birth comes pain dukkha which causes grief and sorrow. It is a psychological cause chain in which the preceding experience causes the succeeding one.\n\nArhat and Bodhisattva:\nThe word of Arhat is called in Sanskrit language or Arahat is called in Pali language and Bodhisattva is called in Sanskrit language or Bodhisatta is called in Pali language are well recognized by in Budha teaching and this ideals to which the Buddhist should follow it. Budhha talks about attains to liberation either by Arhat or Bodhisatta pathway. The Arhat idea and Bodhisattva Idea are frequently ",

      "abstract": "Yoga, with its roots in ancient Indian philosophy, has become a widely practiced discipline around the world. One of the most significant texts in the yoga tradition is the Patanjali Yoga Sutra, which outlines the philosophy, ethics, and techniques of yoga. Despite its historical and philosophical importance, the awareness and understanding of the Yoga Sutra among contemporary yoga instructors remain underexplored, particularly in regions like Iran, where yoga is a relatively new phenomenon. This study aims to investigate the level of awareness, understanding, and application of the Patanjali Yoga Sutra among certified yoga instructors in Iran. A quantitative research design was employed, utilizing a structured survey (16 questions) to assess the knowledge of key principles, philosophical teachings, and practices from the Yoga Sutra. The sample included 115 yoga practitioners who were certified by recognized institutions and had at least one year of teaching experience. A structured survey of 115 certified yoga instructors in Iran revealed a surprising familiarity with core concepts such as \u201cChitta Vritti Nirodha,\u201d understood by 73% of participants, and \u201cAhimsa,\u201d correctly identified by 92%. However, broader knowledge of the Yoga Sutras was notably lacking. For instance, 67.8% of participants were unable to distinguish the Sutras from other classical yoga texts, and 61.7% were unaware of the number of chapters in the text. These findings highlight that while certain foundational concepts have been well integrated into practice, a deeper understanding of the Sutras\u2019 structure, broader topics, and historical context remains limited. The study underscores the importance of enhanced educational initiatives to equip yoga instructors with a more comprehensive grasp of Patanjali\u2019s philosophy, enriching their teaching and practice.",

      "abstract": "PurposeCancer pain is one of the most distressing symptoms, severely impairing patients' quality of life (QoL). This study aimed to assess cancer pain using multidimensional questionnaires and to evaluate the impact of pharmacist-led interventions on pain management and QoL.MethodsA prospective interventional study was conducted among eligible cancer patients. Pain and QoL were assessed using validated multidimensional questionnaires. Pharmacist interventions included counselling, an educational video, and a patient information leaflet. Patients were reassessed post-intervention, and pre- and post-intervention data were analyzed for statistical significance.ResultsA total of 147 cancer patients were enrolled, with nearly equal gender distribution. Breast, buccal mucosa, and lung cancers were most prevalent. Surgery was the predominant treatment, followed by radiation and chemotherapy. Pharmacist-led interventions significantly improved QoL across physical, emotional, social, sleep, and behavioral domains (all p\u2009<\u20090.01), with overall QoL scores rising from 4.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.25 to 10.5\u2009\u00b1\u20092.13 (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The economic domain showed comparatively slight improvement, reflecting persistent financial strain. Use of non-pharmacological strategies such as meditation, physiotherapy, and psychosocial support increased significantly post-intervention.ConclusionA comprehensive assessment with a multidimensional pain questionnaire revealed the broad impact of cancer pain on patients' lives. Pharmacist-led interventions, combining education, counselling, and supportive care, significantly improved pain control and quality of life across physical, emotional, social, and sleep domains. The persistent economic burden indicates the importance of integrated financial support, but our findings highlight the vital role of clinical pharmacists in delivering holistic, patient-centered cancer pain management.",
