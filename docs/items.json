      "abstract": "This paper explores how teachers\u2019 critical consciousness can transform the research process for high school students by intentionally integrating culturally grounded frameworks. Using a phenomenological narrative approach, I reflect on my experience teaching The College Board\u2019s AP Research course during the 2024-25 school year. Central to this work is the Developmental Spiral of Critical Consciousness (DSCC) (Gibson, 2021), a framework developed to support teacher self-inquiry and liberatory pedagogical practices. Guided by this framework, I introduced my student to Sankofa, a Ghanaian principle meaning \u201cto go back and retrieve it, as a lens for understanding reflexivity in academic research. Student reflections demonstrate how Sankofa became a powerful tool for reclaiming personal narrative, strengthening inquiry, and fostering authentic engagement. In the spirit of bell hooks, this work aims to serve as a \u201cmodel of possibility\u201d (hooks, 1994, p. 2) for educators committed to equity, imagination, and transformational learning. Through DSCC-informed pedagogical practices that explicitly taught reflexivity as an iterative, culturally grounded research skill, this study demonstrates how teacher critical consciousness reshaped students\u2019 approaches to topic development, methodological decision-making, and revision within the research process.",

      "abstract": "Objective With growing access to the internet, online mindfulness programmes have become more commonly used to manage physical and mental health conditions. This scoping review aims to determine the nature and extent of the literature, and key characteristics, of online mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) for adults with physical or mental health conditions. Design A scoping review guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute framework. Data sources MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, Allied and Complementary Medicine and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Eligibility criteria Studies focusing on online MBIs, online mindfulness-based stress reduction and online mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) in adults with a physical or mental health condition were included. Data extraction and synthesis Study and participant characteristics, key intervention characteristics, outcome measures and results were abstracted. Results 84 studies were included. Online MBIs have been studied in many different physical and mental health conditions; however, 63 of the included studies were for physical health conditions. MBCT was the most common intervention type assessed, with 33 of the included studies assessing it. Regarding intervention characteristics, intervention duration was similar across intervention type at 8 weeks, with sessions led by therapists, clinicians or mindfulness instructors. Web-based and videoconferencing were the most common delivery formats. Intervention content generally remained similar to standardised MBIs, with the addition of psychoeducation and disease management. Many studies did not report on tailoring the intervention to the participant population. There was a lack of consistency in reporting intervention characteristics. Conclusions This review highlights some evidence for online mindfulness programmes for both physical and mental health conditions. However, intervention componentry remains somewhat obscure, and reporting on tailoring appears relatively sparse. Greater consistency in reporting intervention componentry will improve knowledge and study in this area and enhance the translation of these interventions to clinical settings.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) experience significant psychological distress, impacting outcomes. While mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are beneficial, access is limited. Internet-delivered MBIs (iMBIs) offer an accessible alternative; yet, qualitative understanding of patient experiences with tailored iMBIs for this specific population is lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the facilitators and barriers of patients with HCC post TACE and participated in tailored iMBIs. METHODS: From November 2020 to December 2022, 11 patients with HCC post TACE who had taken part in tailored iMBIs were purposively recruited from a tertiary hospital in Jilin Province. Data were collected through semistructured interviews lasting 30-60 minutes. The interviews were analyzed using conventional content analysis. RESULTS: Five main categories emerged from the analysis: (1) mindfulness mindset, including acceptance, calmness, and mood improvement; (2) improvement of physical discomfort, such as better sleep, pain relief, reduced gastrointestinal symptoms, and increased activity levels; (3) resistance to mindfulness practice, including perceived lack of effectiveness, unsuitable conditions, equipment limitations, and difficulty concentrating; (4) support and encouragement, involving social support, supervision, and professional guidance; and (5) accessibility and convenience characterized by restoration of life balance and user-friendly features of the practice. Each category encompassed several subcategories reflecting the diverse experiences of participants. CONCLUSIONS: While iMBIs were generally perceived as convenient and accessible, challenges such as equipment limitations were noted. Future implementation should focus on enhancing supportive factors to improve adherence, minimizing barriers, and refining the design and delivery of iMBI programs.

      "abstract": "The risk for suicide has been conceptualized as a continuum from dysfunctional psychological and cognitive states to suicidal thoughts and behaviour. Little is known about risk and protective factors along the continuum. In the current study, we assessed ninety-four university students (36 individuals indicated suicidal ideation and 33 reported self-harm) for suicidality, depression, entrapment, defeat, hopelessness, mindfulness, self-compassion, and implicit associations with death/suicide. We used regression models and moderation analyses to test if mindfulness, self-compassion, and implicit association with death/suicide related to suicidal ideation, self-harm, entrapment, or moderated the hypothesized continuum from entrapment to suicidal ideation and from entrapment to self-harm. Analyses were corrected for the severity of depressive symptomatology. Results indicated that lower self-compassion and weaker implicit associations with death/suicide were statistically associated with self-harm, but not suicidal ideation. Mindfulness is trend-wise associated with entrapment and moderated the relation between entrapment and suicidal ideation. Self-compassion nor implicit associations with death/suicide moderated the relation between entrapment and suicidal ideation. Hence, lower self-compassion and weaker implicit associations with death/suicide seem directly related to suicide risk behaviour, whereas mindfulness appears to negatively (i.e., suggestive of a protective role) relate to psychological risk-states earlier in the continuum. Therefore, self-compassion and mindfulness seem promising prevention targets for suicide risk in young adults.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This project aimed to co-create a culturally responsive parenting program integrating Indigenous perspectives through Wayapa Wuurrk, an Aboriginal Earth mindfulness wellbeing practice. Embedded within a parenting app (Daily Growth), the resource supports diverse parents and carers of children aged 2-5years to respond to common parenting challenges. METHODS: Guided by Indigenous governance and a Two-Eyed Seeing framework, the co creation process engaged Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers, content designers and Wayapa Wuurrk practitioners with early years' experience. Cultural responsiveness was ensured through yarning, deep listening (Dadirri), and relational accountability, overseen by a Wisdom Circle of five Aboriginal Wayapa Wuurrk practitioners recognised as Senior Knowledge Holders or Elders. Indigenous knowledges central to Wayapa Wuurrk were adapted into 30 common parenting scenarios and delivered as brief, video-based micro-interventions. RESULTS: The co-created parenting resources provide culturally relevant, Earth-centred parenting strategies that support children's emotional regulation. The inclusion of Wayapa Wuurrk iconography, storytelling and earth-mindfulness enrich program accessibility and relevance. CONCLUSION: Integrating Wayapa Wuurrk within Daily Growth demonstrates the value of Two-Eyed Seeing by weaving Indigenous knowledges with Western parenting approaches, strengthening culturally inclusive support for Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait and non-Indigenous families. Future research will evaluate impacts on parent and child wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) have shown promise improving depression, anxiety, and psychiatric distress, yet real-world engagement remains low. Increasing engagement has great potential to improve the impact of DMHIs, but little is known about the drivers of engagement in naturalistic settings. To better understand predictors of engagement, we examined sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with DMHI usage among a large clinical sample of adults. METHOD: 1223 adults (74% White, 68% women, Mage\u202f=\u202f36.8\u202fyears) with scheduled intake appointments for outpatient psychiatric services were randomized to either a mindfulness-based app (Headspace) or a CBT-based app (SilverCloud). Usage data were automatically collected, and participants were neither required nor compensated to use the apps. RESULTS: Participants engaged with their assigned DMHIs a median of 8\u202fdays, with 88.2% of participants using their assigned DMHI at least once. Participants engaged with Headspace for more than twice as many days [IRR (95% CI)\u202f=\u202f2.4 (2.1, 2.7)] as SilverCloud. Female sex, white race, a college degree, and older age up to 60 predicted greater engagement. Further, depression severity was associated with engagement in a non-linear manner for those assigned to Headspace, with less engagement at minimal/mild and severe symptoms compared to moderate and moderately-severe symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate meaningful differences in engagement between DMHIs based on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. There may be opportunities to improve engagement by tailoring DMHI offerings, with a particular emphasis on meeting the needs of less-engaged populations.",

      "abstract": "Whereas aphantasics report lacking voluntary conscious visual imagery, empirical findings indicate that they employ visual strategies to complete tasks. The discrepancy has led some researchers to propose that aphantasics rely on unconscious visual imagery. This paper instead motivates and defends a \"conscious\" view. Consciousness research uses both visibility and confidence measures. Participants in aphantasia studies are recruited based on their scores on the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ), which closely resembles a visibility measure. To assess whether aphantasics' task-relevant visual imagery is truly unconscious, we should also investigate their confidence in their first-order task performance. The few studies that have explored this suggest that they exhibit good metacognition. These findings therefore support the conscious interpretation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depression frequently affects older adults with chronic illnesses, reducing their quality of life. In Thailand, limited access to mental health services increases the need for preventive interventions. The SMART (Smile, Mindfulness, Attitude, Relax, and Thinking) Elderly Program aimed to assess its effectiveness in preventing depression among older adults. METHODS: Quasi-experimental research design with a repeated-measures approach was used with two groups. The study included 80 older adults diagnosed by a physician with noncommunicable diseases and a depression score of 7 to 12 on the Thai Geriatric Depression Scale (TGDS), indicating risk for depression. Participants were assigned to two groups through multi-stage sampling. The intervention group (n=40) participated in a 6-week SMART Elderly Program, while the control group (n=40) received standard treatment and a handbook for depression prevention. Evaluations took place through in-person interviews at baseline, post-intervention, and at a 3-month follow-up. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: The analysis showed statistically significant differences in knowledge about depression, attitudes toward depression, and TGDS scores between the intervention and control groups at the 3-month follow-up (P<0.001). In the intervention group, these measures also changed significantly from baseline to the 3-month follow-up (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: The SMART Elderly Program significantly reduced depressive symptoms in older adults with chronic illnesses. These results support its use in community health practice and inform health policy to improve preventive mental health care for older adults.",
