      "abstract": "In this study, biopolymer composites based on chitosan (CS) with enhanced optical properties were functionalized using Manganese metal complexes and black tea solution dyes. The results indicate that CS with Mn2+-complexes can produce polymer hybrids with high absorption, high refractive index and controlled optical band gaps, with a significant reduction from 6.24 eV to 1.21 eV. The refractive index and optical dielectric constant measurements show that the doped CS films have more charge carriers and traps than those in pure CS films. The Lorentz-Drude model was used to derive several significant optical parameters, and the W-D model was utilized to calculate the optical moments M-1 changing from 0.35 to 2.13 and M-3 changing from 0.005 to 0.4. It was shown that the doped samples have larger Urbach energy than pure film, increased from 0.29 to 0.55 eV. Tauc and ASF model was also used to calculate the electronic transitions, band structure, and optical characteristics. Bandgap energy based on Tauc model at m\u2009=\u20092, 1/3, 1/2, and 2/3 are 1.77, 1.54, 1.47, and 1.37 eV, based on ASF model are 1.52, 1.42, 1.69, and 1.47 eV, respectively. As a result of changes in the optical diffraction parameters the optical mobility (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$${\\mu }_{opt}$$\\end{document}) changed from 1.67 to 1.27 and optical resistivity \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$${\\rho }_{opt}$$\\end{document} from 9.36\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u201327 to 4.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u201329.

      "abstract": "Mindfulness is originally a concept in Buddhism and has been widely used to improve mental state around the world. Meditative walking, a type of mindfulness practice, is a widespread practice. The main aim of the research is to find how a 20-day practice of mindfulness can improve the practitioners\u2019 concentration. A self-report method was employed. The author reflected on his practices and experiences within a total of 20 days of mindfulness practice by meditative walking at night for 20 min (from 8 to 8.20 pm) every day. He made notes on every single happenstance that he was aware of. The primary assessment was through daily monitoring of increased mindfulness and other internal and external factors influencing the practice. Findings show that regular mindfulness practice improved the concentration level. Specifically, in the first 2 days, the practitioner kept concentration for about 2\u20133 min. On day 5, the concentration level increased up to 7 min. It kept growing to 17 min on day 15. Furthermore, on the final 5 days, the concentration continued to grow and reached the level of 20 min on the last day. Implications of mindfulness practice for concentration are discussed.",

      "abstract": "This conversational paper between Ashwani Kumar and Shane Theunissen explores how meditative inquiry in teaching and learning can foster reverence for nature, life, and learning. Through an organic and reflective conversation rooted in Dialogical Meditative Inquiry (DMI), the authors offer a holistic exploration of the intersections between personal transformation, environmental awareness, and holistic education. The authors emphasize that meditative inquiry challenges predetermined educational outcomes and encourages a profound, personal transformation that can lead to social change. Authors discuss how meditative inquiry can facilitate learning relationships that promote student autonomy and awareness, and how it can instill reverence for life. The paper considers how awe, wonder, and reverence can shift educational paradigms from mechanistic models toward contemplative, relational approaches informed by Indigenous and meditative perspectives. The conversation also highlights the strong connection between meditative inquiry and Indigenous ways of knowing, both of which are rooted in a deep reverence for nature and a harmonious relationship with the natural world. The paper promotes a contemplative and holistic approach to education and living, suggesting that personal transformation through meditative inquiry can contribute to a more respectful and interconnected relationship with oneself, others, and the environment. By challenging dominant narratives in education and promoting meditative and emergent dialogue, the authors advocate for education as a regenerative and transformative practice grounded in deep listening, interconnectedness, and awareness.\nKeywords: meditative inquiry, reverence, dialogical meditative inquiry, holistic education, nature, Indigenous philosophy \u00a0",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The mechanisms through which mindfulness and third wave-based digital programs exert their effects on stress reduction remain poorly understood. Identifying these mediators is essential to optimize their implementation, particularly in health care settings. This approach is particularly relevant for health care professionals, who are constantly exposed to high levels of emotional demands, work overload, and risk of burnout, especially in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the growing need for scalable and accessible mental health support in this population, such digital programs remain scarce and underused. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to analyze the psychological mechanisms through which the MINDxYOU online program may contribute to stress reduction among health care professionals, focusing on a mediation model. Specifically, we explored if variables such as resilience and facets of mindfulness, compassion, and acceptance mediated the effects of the intervention on perceived stress. METHODS: In a stepped-wedge cluster randomized design, 357 health professionals from health centers in Aragon and M\u00e1laga, Spain, were recruited. They were divided into 6 clusters, 3 per region, and randomly assigned to one of the 3 sequences, each starting with a control phase and then transitioning to the intervention phase (the MINDxYOU program) after 8, 16, or 24 weeks. This self-guided, web-based program, designed to be completed over 8 weeks, included weekly contact (via WhatsApp, call, or email) from the research team to promote adherence. Participants were assessed on the web every 8 weeks for 5 assessments. Perceived stress was the study's primary outcome, with additional measures of clinical factors (anxiety, depression, and somatization) and process variables (resilience, mindfulness, compassion, and acceptance). Mediation models using mixed-effects regressions and bootstrap resampling (1000 iterations) were applied to analyze the direct and indirect effects of the treatment on psychological outcomes. RESULTS: Resilience emerged as the most consistent and significant mediator, exerting a relevant indirect effect on reducing stress (\u03b2=-1.41; P=.02), anxiety (\u03b2=-0.88; P=.03), and depression (\u03b2=-0.97; P=.01), even in multivariate models. Mindfulness facets such as observing, describing, and nonreacting also showed significant, albeit less consistent, mediating effects. In contrast, compassion and acceptance were weakly associated and did not play a significant mediating role. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate resilience as the key psychological mediator. Strengthening resilience through online interventions appears to be a crucial pathway for reducing stress and emotional symptoms in this population. Specific mindfulness skills may also contribute to the intervention's therapeutic effect, although with less robust evidence.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Peripheral nerve injuries can lead to paralysis, sensory loss, chronic pain, and profound psychological and vocational consequences. Recent UK guidelines recommend biopsychosocial rehabilitation, yet qualitative evidence suggest gaps in service provision. This study explored current rehabilitation and perceived barriers among therapists treating adults with peripheral nerve injuries. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was distributed to UK physiotherapists and occupational therapists experienced in upper and lower limb peripheral nerve injury rehabilitation. Questions captured demographics, treatment strategies before and after reinnervation, access to psychological support, and perceived organisational barriers. Descriptive analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: Fifty-three respondents (60% physiotherapists, 40% occupational therapists) completed the survey; 70% had more than 10\u00a0years' experience. Ninety eight percent of respondents treated adults with upper limb nerve injuries. Motor and sensory interventions (active and passive range of motion, splinting, strength training, and functional activity) were reported as \"always/frequently\" used by >80% of respondents. Over a quarter of respondents (28%) occasionally/rarely used pain neuroscience education. Other specific psychological interventions including cognitive behavioural techniques and mindfulness were rarely used (<30% always/frequently). Over half respondents reported no outpatient access to clinical psychology. Organisational barriers included limited time, funding, skilled staff, and absence of local guidelines. However, 83% believed therapists could deliver more psychologically informed care. CONCLUSIONS: UK rehabilitation for adults with peripheral nerve injuries remains predominantly biomedical, with limited integration of psychologically informed care and limited access to Clinical Psychology. Addressing systemic barriers and evaluating digital or hybrid models may enable more biopsychosocial, patient-centred care.",

      "abstract": "Chronic pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide and chronic neuropathic pain (NP) disproportionately affects individuals with unmet healthcare needs, especially those facing health inequities. This scoping review addressed three research questions: (1) What are the characteristics and outcomes of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness, and meditative-based intervention studies, designed to manage NP? (2) Are these intervention studies including participants from populations experiencing h2ealth inequities? (3) Are the interventions customized to meet the needs of people experiencing health inequities? Ten databases were searched for studies focused on the search terms cognitive behavioral therapy, CBT, mindfulness meditation, and neuropathic pain. In total, 1732 abstracts were screened and a total of 24 articles from 22 original studies were included. The primary characteristics of the studies showed that 99% of participants had NP attributable to diabetes, cancer, or spinal cord injury. Outcomes were consistent with previous reviews, demonstrating promise for CBT, mindfulness, and meditative-based therapies in relieving NP. However, demographics were poorly reported, and with little diversity among participants. Individuals from groups experiencing health inequities were largely unrepresented. While 55% of studies tailored intervention materials and provided content to support long-term practice, few included long-term follow-ups to evaluate sustained impact. In general, research on this topic has fallen short in including and addressing the needs of people experiencing health inequities. Future research should prioritize broader participant inclusion criteria, involve individuals with lived experience in intervention design and delivery, and conduct long-term follow-ups to enhance the accessibility, relevance, and sustainability of NP interventions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Burnout among healthcare providers can adversely impact their performance and patient care. Vital Anaesthesia Simulation Training (VAST) Wellbeing is a 1-day course designed to promote personal and professional well-being and to reduce burnout for healthcare providers in low-resource settings. VAST Wellbeing has demonstrated benefits in this context but has never been evaluated in a conflict zone. This study assessed the influence of VAST Wellbeing among healthcare workers practicing in the EMERGENCY-NGO Salam Centre for Cardiac Surgery in Sudan amidst a conflict. METHODS: This mixed-methods study was designed to explore participants' experience of VAST Wellbeing offered in Sudan to learn about benefits and challenges to this training in a conflict zone. Our team used in-depth qualitative interviews with purposively selected course participants. Perceived social stigma of receiving mental health support and attitudes toward help seeking for mental health were also quantitatively assessed using the Stigma Scale for Receiving Psychological Help and the General Help-Seeking Questionnaire, respectively. RESULTS: Sixty healthcare providers attended the course; 35 completed quantitative measures, and 12 were interviewed. Stigma for receiving mental health support decreased comparing median [interquartile range {IQR}] precourse to postcourse scores (8.0 [6-9] versus 6.0 [3-8], P =.005). Willingness to seek help in the event of a mental health concern significantly increased when comparing precourse to postcourse scores (3.4 [2.6 to 3.9] versus 4.6 [3.9 to 5.0], P >.001). Three major themes and nine subthemes were identified during qualitative data analysis. Theme 1: The influence of conflict manifested as participants reporting persistent fear and stress and that the workplace was extremely strained. Theme 2: In social context it was noted that the training reduced social stigma, strengthened of a sense of community, and led to subtle changes in the workplace environment. Theme 3: The training contributed to new learning and practices, such as greater recognition of burnout and engaging in personal well-being practices. Acceptance of mindfulness was mixed, albeit with recognition of its positive effects. Despite many contextual challenges, participants reported the course to be needed and relevant. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that VAST Wellbeing was pertinent and impactful in a conflict zone. It helped to foster a stronger sense of community, reduce stigma around mental health discussions, increase the acceptability of help-seeking, and encourage participants to adopt strategies for self-care and well-being.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is the most prevalent chronic pain condition among veterans, contributing to disability, reduced quality of life, and opioid dependence. Complementary and integrative health (CIH) approaches offer evidence-based, non-pharmacological alternatives that may improve pain management, enhance patient satisfaction, lower healthcare costs, and reduce opioid dependence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The objective of the study was to synthesize current evidence on CIH approaches for veterans with cLBP, evaluate their impact on pain, function, and well-being, and identify implications for policy, health system implementation, and future research. The key questions of the study included: what is the effectiveness of CIH modalities in reducing cLBP intensity among veterans, what are their broader effects on health outcomes, opioid use, and quality of life, what barriers exist to implementation within the VA, and what research and policy priorities are needed to optimize veteran-centered CIH care? A narrative synthesis of peer-reviewed literature published between 2010 and 2025 was conducted, prioritizing studies specific to veterans and incorporating systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and evidence maps. A patient-centered, biopsychosocial, and whole-health framework guided the analysis. RESULTS: Evidence for CIH in veterans remains limited compared to that in civilian populations, but it demonstrates promise. Battlefield acupuncture demonstrated clinically meaningful reductions in pain, although yoga, Tai Chi, Qigong, and mindfulness offered modest improvements in pain and functional outcomes. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, Chiropractic care, and massage showed mixed results, with low to moderate certainty and limited durability. Multimodal approaches integrating CIH with conventional care have demonstrated the strongest outcomes, including reduced opioid prescriptions, improved coping, and potential cost savings. Barriers to care include provider shortages, administrative challenges, and uneven access across facilities. CONCLUSIONS: CIH approaches represent patient-centered and holistic strategies with the potential to reduce pain, enhance function, and mitigate opioid reliance among veterans with cLBP. Broader, standardized implementation and veteran-specific trials are necessary to strengthen the evidence base and guide the sustainable integration of this approach into the VA health system.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The study aimed to provide evidence to support optimal interventions for alleviating anxiety and depression symptoms in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) through a systematic review and network meta-analysis. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from their inceptions to January 2, 2025 was performed. The criteria for inclusion defined were as follows: (1) The study population consisted of female PCOS patients; (2) interventions included psychological therapy, exercise, drug treatment, or digital intervention; (3) studies that reported changes in anxiety and depression scores; and (4) randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Two reviewers independently screened the literature and extracted the data. Disagreements were resolved by consulting a third party. Standardized mean difference (SMD) was used for data recording in this study. The analysis of data was carried out based on a random-effects model, while network meta-analysis was implemented through R 4.4.0 and Just Another Gibbs Sampler (JAGS) 4.3.1. We conducted a Bayesian random-effects network meta-analysis (NMA) and ranked interventions using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). RESULTS: This study included a total of 25 RCTs, involving 1,453 female PCOS patients, to evaluate the effects of various interventions in alleviating anxiety and depression symptoms. Effective interventions included emotion-focused therapy (EFT), peer support (PS), omega-3 plus vitamin E (O3+VE), and mindfulness stress management (MSM). Other interventions, such as metformin and vitamin D plus probiotics (VD+Pro), showed no significant benefit compared with control. Data on PS for anxiety were not analyzed in the present network meta-analysis because relevant trials could not be connected within the network structure. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that EFT and PS emerge as promising interventions in alleviating anxiety and depression symptoms in PCOS patients. Interventions such as O3+VE and MSM also showed potential in improving emotional states.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS), a neurodegenerative disease, frequently causes sexual dysfunction (SD) besides the well-known motor impairment, which significantly reduces patients' quality of life (QOL). AIM: This meta-analysis evaluates the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for MS-related SD. METHODS: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a systematic search of PubMed, ScienceDirect, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases identified randomized and clinical trials; data were extracted, the risk of bias was assessed, and meta-analyses were conducted. OUTCOMES: The primary outcomes were changes in sexual function, satisfaction, and QOL. RESULTS: A total of 34 studies were included and eligible for meta-analysis. Pooled analyses revealed that yoga did not significantly improve sexual function standardized mean difference (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.18,  CLINICAL IMPLICATION: Tailored exercise and psychoeducational interventions can be recommended to improve sexual function and satisfaction in patients with MS. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: Strengths include adherence to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and comprehensive analysis; limitations are the heterogeneity of interventions and the short-term nature of the included studies. CONCLUSION: Tailored exercise and psychoeducation significantly benefit sexual function in MS, while other therapies like yoga require refinement; future research should investigate long-term outcomes and patient-specific factors.",

      "abstract": "This study is an evaluation of group-based acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)-a transdiagnostic therapeutic approach-in adolescents with anxiety and/or depressive psychiatric disorders in a community hospital outpatient setting. The objective was to evaluate treatment effects on 1) symptom reduction and 2) psychological flexibility measured by underlying ACT processes (avoidance, fusion, mindfulness, valued action) and evaluate whether improvements represent reliable and clinically significant change. Measures were completed by 99 outpatients aged 13 to 18 pre- and post-treatment and at 3-month follow-up. Generalized estimating equation analysis and pairwise comparisons were used to identify changes in symptoms and ACT processes over time. Results showed decreases in anxiety symptoms (pre to post d\u2009=\u2009-.50; post to 3-month follow-up d\u2009=\u2009-.41); 2) depression symptoms (d\u2009=\u2009-.51; d\u2009=\u2009-.46); 3) and avoidance/fusion (d\u2009=\u2009-.60; d\u2009=\u2009-.49), increased mindfulness (d\u2009=\u2009-.70; d\u2009=\u2009-.34); and enhanced commitment to values-based action from post-treatment to 3-month follow-up (d\u2009=\u2009.25). About half of participants reporting clinically elevated symptoms before treatment showed reliable and clinically significant improvement 3-months after treatment ended. Results support the utility of group-based ACT with adolescents. This is the first evaluation conducted in Canadian adolescents seeking community hospital outpatient services for wide ranging and complex mental health difficulties. Future research should continue to take a transdiagnostic perspective and include a control or comparison group and adolescents from different settings.",
