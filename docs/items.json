      "abstract": "Mindfulness is one of the growing techniques for promoting mental health and reducing stress among adolescents. This paper presents a systematic review of the effects of various mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), including mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), on the stress, emotion regulation, and well-being of adolescents. It reviews the innovative applications and potential of digital mindfulness interventions from both physiological and psychological perspectives, including mobile apps and virtual reality (VR). The paper critically assesses the potential risks of current applications of mindfulness, the loss of its essence through commercialization (\"McMindfulness\"), and methodological flaws in previous research. The review indicates that to optimize the potential of mindfulness, future practices must change from the \"one-size-fits-all\" model to \"precision intervention,\" from \"fragmented training\" to \"professional empowerment,\" and keep up a critical balance from \"technology worship\" to \"humanistic integration.\" Future research should focus on more rigorous long-term follow-up studies and cross-cultural comparisons so as to provide more effective, cautious, and sustainable support for the promotion of adolescent mental health.",

      "abstract": "Inclusive research is needed to understand how contemplative practices are used by people of diverse identities. Metta meditation-also known as loving-kindness meditation-may be particularly relevant for people committed to equity and justice because of the social nature of the practice. Using community-based participatory research and an intersectional framework, we assessed how people in a diverse meditation community teach and practice metta meditation. In partnership between university researchers and a community-based meditation center, we conducted virtual focus groups on experiences with metta meditation during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used reflexive thematic analysis to analyze focus group data, with a member checking process to include participant feedback. Forty-seven people participated in six focus groups (Mage = 47; 62% lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex or asexual; 23% Asian, 19% Black, 13% Hispanic/Latina/o, 32% White, 24% multiracial). Qualitative analysis identified three central themes: (1) the importance of a community of practice for creating a sense of belonging (including during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic); (2) the benefits of metta practice for cultivating compassion and equanimity; and (3) the use of metta practice to cope with harmful situations, including individual-level stressors and structural oppression. Metta meditation supported participants in navigating stressors and injustice. Community-based spaces designed to cultivate belonging among diverse communities can support people to connect contemplative practice with their efforts for social change.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: PTSD patients who experienced interpersonal violence are susceptible to trauma-related guilt and shame and often show unsatisfactory treatment response. C-METTA combines cognitive techniques and loving-kindness meditation. It has shown promising effects in reducing trauma-related guilt and shame. Objective: We examined the effectiveness of C-METTA within a quasi-experimental one-group pretest-posttest trial focusing on survivors of interpersonal violence, who suffered from trauma-related guilt and shame. An additional objective was to examine variables potentially associated with lower treatment response (childhood trauma, cumulative trauma, and PTSD chronicity). Method: We treated 25 individuals (age\u2009=\u200919\u201361, 96% women) with PTSD following interpersonal violence. We predicted that C-METTA would significantly reduce (a) PTSD symptoms (measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale, the PTSD Symptom-Checklist Version 5, and the Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory), (b) feelings of guilt (measured by the Trauma Related Guilt Inventory) and (c) feelings of shame (measured by the Trauma Related Shame Inventory). To analyse treatment effects, we conducted repeated-measures MANOVAs. Further, we investigated the impact of childhood trauma, cumulative trauma and PTSD chronicity symptoms on treatment effectiveness exploratively via additional MANCOVAs. Results: Analyses showed significant and large effects of C-METTA on reducing PTSD symptoms (ranging from d\u2009=\u20091.12 to d\u2009=\u20091.67), feelings of guilt (d\u2009=\u20091.54) and shame (d\u2009=\u20091.26). Childhood trauma, cumulative trauma and PTSD chronicity did not affect treatment effectiveness. Conclusion: Our findings support previous research concerning the effectiveness of C-METTA and add promising evidence for the effectiveness of C-METTA to reduce PTSD following interpersonal violence. Effectiveness was independent of childhood trauma, trauma-duration and PTSD chronicity. Regression to the mean should be considered as a confounding factor. We suggest more research to support the results. C-METTA might increase PTSD treatment diversity and offer patients a greater bandwidth of options according to their preferences and the respective symptomatology. HIGHLIGHTS C-METTA is an intervention that addresses trauma-related guilt and shame and combines cognitive interventions with loving-kindness meditation. Focusing on survivors of interpersonal violence, the effectiveness of C-METTA was examined within a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest trial. C-METTA led to a reduction in trauma-related guilt and shame and PTSD symptoms independently of childhood trauma, cumulative trauma or trauma chronicity.",

      "abstract": "Psychosocial interventions for adolescents with nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) still needs investigation. This study aims to explore the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of twelve weeks of loving-kindness meditation (mett\u0101) and mindfulness of breathing (\u0101n\u0101p\u0101nasati) for adolescents with NSSI and their parents. This was a prospective, quasi-experimental, mixed-method pilot study with no control group. Twenty-eight adolescents and their parents participated in the twelve weeks of loving-kindness meditation and mindfulness of breathing practice. Self-report questionnaires on NSSI behaviors, depressive symptoms, attachment to parents, and parenting behaviors were administered at baseline, mid-intervention, postintervention, and 3-month follow-up only from the adolescents. Semi-structured interviews about the feasibility of the intervention were conducted with 25 parent-adolescents\u2019 dyads at post-intervention. A modest dropout of n\u2009=\u20094 (14.2%) was found for adolescents. Nine parents dropouts, with the dropout rate being 33%. The overall satisfaction score of adolescents for the intervention is 4.27 out of 5. Quantitative analysis revealed that there is a significant decrease in adolescents NSSI behavior at postintervention and 3-month follow-up and a significant decrease in adolescents\u2019 depressive symptoms at three months follow-up.Qualitative analysis shows that adolescents general has positive attitude toward the intervention, and believe the individual mindfulness practices peaceful but challenging. The experiences in group activity and interactions were rich, but participants failed in persisting the intervention because of multiple obstacles. Attempts to practice mindfulness influenced adolescents\u2019 self-injury behavior and also bring positive change in adolescents\u2019 emotion. Parents reported increase in emotion regulation and positive change in parenting attitude and behavior. Both adolescents and parents perceived parent-child relationship improvements. Twelve weeks of loving-kindness meditation and mindfulness of breathing seems feasible among adolescents with NSSI and their parents. An adequately powered Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is needed to examine this intervention\u2019s effectiveness for NSSI behavior, emotional symptoms, and family interaction. The trial was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2200056515) at 7th February 2022.",

      "abstract": "Background: Childhood anxiety and stress are increasingly prevalent issues worldwide, having effects on cognitive growth and emotional health. Although standard interventions are available, greater interest is being sparked in culturally sensitive, non-invasive approaches. This research investigated the application of Buddhist meditation practices to alleviate stress and anxiety in children between the ages of 8 - 12 years. Method: A mixed-method study was carried out with 30 purposely selected children from Central Province, Sri Lanka (16 girls and 14 boys), with ages ranging from 8-12 years old. Participants completed an 8-week meditation program consisting of An\u0101p\u0101nasati, Metta Bh\u0101van\u0101 and Vipassan\u0101. Pre-test and post-test psychological assessment using RCMAS and PSS-C were administered, along with interviews conducted by child psychologists and individuals with meditation, mindfulness and well-being experience. Validity was established through reviewing tools by expert review and standardized measures. Results: Following the intervention, substantial mean reductions were observed for anxiety according to RCMAS (Boys:21.4 [Pre-test]; 14.2 [Post-test]; Girls: ????) and for stress as of PSS-C (M pre = 18.7, M post 11.9). \u0100n\u0101p\u0101nasati proved beneficial for regulating acute stress response, Metta Bh\u0101van\u0101 improved emotional regulation and compassion, and Vipassan\u0101 promoted insight into emotional conditioning. General improvements were also seen in attention, emotional regulation, and stress-resilience. Lastly, no statistically significant differences were found for anxiety or stress scores by gender difference, within pre- and post-intervention, respectively. Conclusions: Buddhist meditation is an inexpensive, effective approach to childhood mental health promotion. The practices can be integrated into school and mental health clinics with appropriate modification. Although the study yielded promising results, follow-up and control conditions on the long-term effect are to be included in subsequent studies to determine durable effect and generalizability.",

      "abstract": "This research aims to explore the role of vegetarianism in building spiritual well-being according to Buddhist teachings at Maha Vihara Maitreya Duta Palembang. This research uses a qualitative approach through interviews and literature studies with Buddhist practitioners and spiritual experts. The results and discussion of this study show that vegetarianism is in harmony with the core principles of Buddhism such as ahimsa (non-violence), Karuna (compassion), and metta (loving-kindness). This practice helps reduce negative karma and increase positive karma by avoiding killing animals for food consumption. Additionally, a vegetarian diet is also known to support the development of self-control, discipline and inner calm, which are essential in the Buddhist practice of meditation and contemplation. And it is recommended that future researchers be able to develop research like this even better so that it can fill in the deficiencies in this research.",

      "abstract": "Buddhism teaches the concept and practice of developing the mind to achieve true happiness. This qualitative research, conducted through a literature review, examines the concept and practice of developing the mind in Buddhism. The data analysis technique used content analysis, selecting items that align with the research objectives. This research found that the concept of developing equanimity is crucial for facing all of life's problems. To practice equanimity (upekha), one can train oneself to overcome three traits that conflict with equanimity: attachment, indifference, anger, and ill will. The practice of equanimity can be directed at three things: (1) overcoming attachment to loved ones through meditation on impermanence; (2) overcoming indifference to strangers who are neither friends nor enemies through meditation on arousing loving-kindness (metta); and (3) overcoming anger and ill will toward those who harm others by contemplating the causes and conditions of their harmful actions.",

      "abstract": "This study assesses the impact of green roofs on building energy efficiency within the hyper-dense, rapidly\nurbanizing context of Ebute Metta, Lagos, Nigeria. Employing systematic desk research, it synthesizes global evidence and\nlocal data to evaluate thermal performance, retrofit viability, and policy frameworks. Findings indicate green roofs can\nreduce cooling energy consumption by 15-25% in Lagos's tropical climate through evapotranspiration and thermal\nbuffering, significantly lowering peak electricity demand. Key barriers include structural limitations in existing buildings\n(72% of stock), high installation costs (\u20a625,000/m2), and policy gaps in Nigeria's building code. Lightweight extensive\nsystems using optimized local substrates (e.g., laterite-stone blends) and drought-tolerant native vegetation are identified as\nviable retrofit solutions, with community co-operative models reducing payback periods to 6-9 years through cost-sharing\nand recycled materials. Beyond energy savings, green roofs deliver critical co-benefits including mitigating urban heat\nislands (4.2\u00b0C surface cooling observed in Lagos pilots), reducing stormwater runoff by 27%, and improving air quality.\nThe study concludes that green roofs offer a multi-functional resilience strategy for Ebute Metta but require integrated\npolicy interventions\u2014including revised building mandates, financial incentives (tax rebates, density bonuses), and local\nsupply chain development\u2014to overcome socioeconomic and regulatory hurdles. Recommendations emphasize phased\nimplementation prioritizing public buildings and community-driven models.",

The data was analyzed by the Chi-Square test to determine the relationship between variables. The results showed that the Hb level \u2265 11 g/dl was related to better healing of surgical wounds compared to Hb < 11 g/dl (p = 0.013). In addition, rapid and normal early mobilization significantly improved wound healing compared to slow mobilization (p = 0.025). This study concluded that Hb levels and early mobilization had a significant relationship with wound healing in post-sectio caesarean section. These findings can be used as a reference in postoperative management to improve the quality of patient recovery.",

When Myanmar Buddhists encounter conflicts in their daily lives, it is uncertain whether they can manage these issues using mett\u0101 (loving-kindness), despite frequently reciting the Metta Sutta and practicing mett\u0101 as they interpret it. This article examines the ways in which Myanmar Buddhists apply mett\u0101 (loving-kindness) to manage conflicts as part of their daily\u2002lives. The research examines the fundamental values of saddh\u0101 (faith), v\u012briya (effort), sati (mindfulness), pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 (wisdom), and s\u012bla (morality) to understand how to develop and utilize mett\u0101 in effectively handling conflicts. The study aims to explore the mett\u0101 practice among Myanmar Buddhist people by raising awareness of the challenges and opportunities in applying mett\u0101. A thorough study of the mett\u0101 practice is therefore essential if one is to completely investigate the effective mett\u0101 application (EMA).",

      "abstract": "The decline in national character, evidenced by various social problems, underscores the urgency of holistic and sustainable character education. The golden age of early childhood is a crucial phase for instilling fundamental values, as children at this age possess unique characteristics and are highly receptive to environmental stimuli. This literature review aims to analyze the role of Metta, a concept of universal loving-kindness from Buddhist teachings, in shaping the character of early childhood. The research method is a qualitative literature study, analyzing and synthesizing information from journal articles, books, and scientific sources related to Metta, child developmental psychology, and spirituality-based interventions. The analysis reveals that Metta is not merely a philosophical concept but a practical framework that can be implemented. The principles of Metta\u2014such as loving-kindness, non-violence, and the wish for others' well-being\u2014have a substantial link to the development of pro-social behavior, empathy, and emotional regulation in children. These findings are supported by studies on mindfulness-based interventions which show significant improvements in the social-emotional competence of preschoolers. This report also identifies Classroom Action Research (PTK) as an ideal methodology for empirically testing the effectiveness of Metta-based learning in the future. The proposed PTK framework is intended to serve as a guide for researchers and practitioners. The conclusion of this study is that Metta holds great potential as a foundation for early childhood character education and deserves consideration as a component of a comprehensive curriculum.",

The aim is to understand the role of Metta Bhavana in the spiritual life of the congregation, which makes it an important part of their religious practice. This research uses a qualitative approach with William James' theory of religious experience and contextual pragmatism. James' theory focuses on how individuals experience and interpret spiritual experiences, while pragmatism evaluates the benefits of practices based on practical effects in daily life. These two theories were used to analyze the impact of Metta Bhavana on the mental health of the community, including personal, emotional, and social aspects. Data were collected through field observations and interviews with seven resource persons: a monastery administrator, a bhante, and five congregants. The results showed that Metta Bhavana helped the community to overcome various mental health problems arising from life issues such as failure, household disharmony, and future anxiety. The meditation practice was shown to reduce stress, improve mental well-being, and strengthen social relationships among community members. Metta Bhavana has a positive impact on the personal, emotional, and life-transforming aspects of the community, in line with William James' theory. This research can serve as a basis for developing broader meditation practices to support the mental and spiritual health of congregants.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Einleitung: Mit der Compassion Focused Therapy und der Metta-basierten Therapie liegen zwei Verfahren vor, deren zentraler Ansatzpunkt die F\u00f6rderung von Mitgef\u00fchl und Wohlwollen sich selbst und anderen gegen\u00fcber ist. Ziel der vorliegenden systematischen Literatur\u00fcbersicht ist, den aktuellen Forschungsstand zur Wirksamkeit der beiden Verfahren f\u00fcr die Reduktion psychopathologischer Symptomatik sowie zur Steigerung des Selbstmitgef\u00fchls zu untersuchen. Methodik: Es wurde eine systematische Literaturrecherche auf den Datenbanken Google Scholar, PubMed, PsycINFO und Web of Science durchgef\u00fchrt, um diejenigen Studien zu identifizieren, die entweder Compassion Focused Therapy oder Metta-basierte Therapie in einer klinisch relevanten Stichprobe anwendeten. Ergebnisse: Es konnten 21 Studien mit einem randomisierten, kontrollierten Design identifiziert werden. Insgesamt wurden die Daten von 1\u2019102 Versuchspersonen in die systematische Literatur\u00fcbersicht miteinbezogen. F\u00fcr beide Verfahren l\u00e4sst sich eine Verbesserung der psychopathologischen Symptomatik und des Selbstmitgef\u00fchls feststellen. Nach aktueller Studienlage besteht eine h\u00f6here Evidenzlage f\u00fcr die Wirksamkeit der Compassion Focused Therapy im Vergleich zur Metta-basierten Therapie. Schlussfolgerung: Beide Verfahren stellen eine sinnvolle Erweiterung des psychotherapeutischen Verfahrensrepertoires dar. Zugleich zeigte sich jedoch auch ein deutlicher Unterschied zwischen beiden Verfahren, sodass innerhalb der Compassion Focused Therapy ein breiteres Spektrum an kognitiv-verhaltenstherapeutischen Methoden zum Einsatz kommt, die auch f\u00fcr zuk\u00fcnftige Weiterentwicklungen der Metta-basierten Therapie in Erw\u00e4gung gezogen werden sollten.",

      "abstract": "Background: Spondylolysis and Spondylolisthesis are causes of low back pain and spinal instability. There is a lack of CT-based prevalence studies in Sub-Saharan Africa \nAims: The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of lumbar spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis, the vertebral levels affected, and the prevalence of spondylolytic (isthmic) spondylolisthesis vs non-spondylolytic spondylolisthesis, in patients who underwent an abdominal CT or CT urography in FMC Ebute Metta for reasons other than back pain. \nMethodology: The study was a retrospective descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study utilizing abdominopelvic CTs obtained in the radiology department of the Federal Medical Center, Ebute Metta. A total of 283 tomographs (belonging to 185 women and 98 men) were included in this study. \nResults: A total of 12 spondylolysis cases were observed detected in 11 patients (11/283, 3.9%). Majority (10/12, 83.3%) of the cases of spondylolysis were bilateral. Most of the cases of spondylolysis occurred at the L5 vertebral level (8/12, 66.7%). A total of 35 spondylolisthesis cases were observed in 33 patients (33/283, 11.7%). The most common level of involvement in spondylolisthesis among subjects in this study was L4/5 (16/35 cases, 45.7%). Majority of the subjects with spondylolisthesis had no co-existing spondylolysis (30/33, 90.9%). There were no significant differences in the rates of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis between both sexes. There was no significant association of spondylolysis with age, but there was statistically significant difference (p=.000) in the prevalence of spondylolisthesis between the different age groups. \nConclusion: This study demonstrates that the prevalence of spondylolysis in a Nigerian adult population is lower than that reported in most non-Black cohorts. Further multi-center studies incorporating larger and more diverse populations, together with clinical and genetic correlates, are warranted to clarify the epidemiological patterns and clinical significance of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis in sub-Saharan Africa.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: PT. As a construction company, Nuansa Metta Abadi (NMA) has a big responsibility to ensure its production employees' performance stays on point. However, according to internal company data, most employees don't meet the standards. This is probably because of high workloads and financial compensation that employees don't feel is fair or reasonable. This study aims to analyse how workload and monetary compensation, both individually and in combination, impact the job performance of production staff at PT. Nuansa Metta Abadi.Methods: The data for this study were collected through questionnaires and records, making it a quantitative study. Forty-two individuals working in the production department participated in the survey. The analytical process employed quantitative descriptive and correlational approaches, complemented by multiple linear regression and determination coefficient techniques to evaluate the data.Results: The study demonstrates that each variable\u2014workload and financial compensation\u2014positively contributes to employee performance when assessed in isolation. Simultaneously, both variables also significantly influence the performance of production employees.Conclusion and suggestion: PT. Nuansa Metta Abadi is advised to improve work environment comfort, ensure timely compensation, and enforce punctual task completion. These efforts support stronger motivation and performance. Future research should examine broader variables and larger samples to deepen understanding and broaden the study's theoretical scope.\nKeywords: Workload, Financial Compensation, Employee Performance, Production, Construction.",

      "abstract": "This research aims to increase student activity by using the Problem Baset Learning learning method at the Saraniyadhamma Vihara Giri Metta Bhavana Arama Buddhist Sunday School, North Lombok. This type of research uses Class Action Research (PTK). The research subjects were 10 Buddhist Sunday School (SMB) students at Majjhima Sekkha (junior high school) and Maha Sekkha (high school/vocational school equivalent). Data collection techniques are observation, interviews, questionnaires and documentation. Data analysisi is the form of PTK or observation to determine the level of activity of SMB students through the Problem Baset Learning learning method by looking at indicators of student activity. The results of the research show that student activity through the problem base learning method can be proven by pre-action results that none of the 10 students have reached the level of student activity, the average student scored very less active. Cycle I experienced an increase with 2 students who were very active (9-10). In cycle II there was an increase again to 10 students reaching a level of student activity with a score of 9-10 (very active). This can be seen from the results of observations with indicators of frequency of asking, response to teacher questions, and initiative in completing assignments. It can be concluded that the application of the problem ased learning method is said to be effective in increasing the activity of Saraniyadhamma Vihara Giri Metta Bhavana Arama Buddhist Sunday School students.",

      "abstract": "Within the Nigerian context, rent determination has remained unregulated over the years, with tenants and landlords viewing the process differently. Focusing on the Ebute-Metta area of Lagos, this study assesses the nexus between the number of bedrooms and the rental value of residential properties. The study utilised a quantitative approach that surveys two population categories: Estate Surveyors/Valuers and Residents of Ebute Metta. The study identified the predominant type of residential properties based on number of bedrooms, ascertained the rental values of the properties, and explored tenants' preferences for determining rent, especially concerning the number of bedrooms. The findings show that blocks of flats, multi-tenanted apartments and tenement buildings, containing mainly one-bedroom, room-self, single rooms and, occasionally, three-bedrooms, were the predominant type of residential properties in the area. The rental values of each were determined in different ranges. The number of bedrooms was considered extremely significant in improving rental value and was highly prioritised by property owners and developers. However, tenants viewed variables such as security and amenities as more important than number of bedrooms, although the latter factor mattered to them when they needed accommodation for extended family members and guests or when they required extra storage space.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic musculoskeletal pain, particularly in patients with obesity, poses significant challenges due to increased pain sensitivity, reduced mobility, and systemic inflammation. Obesity aggravates mechanical constraints on the joints and increases systemic inflammation, exacerbating certain medical conditions and making conventional therapeutic approaches less likely to succeed. Conventional therapies often show limited efficacy, necessitating innovative approaches. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study evaluated the short-term effectiveness of a mindfulness and motor imagery-based intervention delivered via an app (SAS YUZIT), on the pain, functionality, and quality of life of patients with obesity and chronic knee pain. METHODS: A prospective, single-center study was conducted over 1 month by including 30 patients (BMI >30 kg/m2) experiencing chronic knee pain (\u22653 months) who did not need surgery. Patients underwent two video-guided motor imagery sessions, focusing on neuromuscular reactivation. Functional scores, including the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) score, were assessed before and after intervention. Paired t tests were used to analyze score improvements, with P<.05 deemed significant. RESULTS: Significant improvements were observed across all parameters. The mean overall SANE score improved by 51% (P<.001). The minimal clinically important difference was therefore approximately 6.7 points. The observed mean improvement (25 points) exceeded this threshold by more than threefold, indicating a clinically meaningful improvement in functional status. The mean (SD) KOOS score increased by 56% (P<.001) from 40.89 (16.7) to 63.79 (14.6). The mean (SD) SF-36 scores showed substantial enhancements in both physical (from 39.7 [20.8] to 65.9 [18.8]; +66%; P<.001) and mental components (from 47.2 [23.1] to 64 [21]; +36%; P<.001). Patient satisfaction with this method was rated 4.5/5, and no adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Video-guided motor imagery demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing pain and improving the functionality and quality of life of patients with obesity and chronic knee pain. By targeting central neuromuscular circuits through guided visualization exercises, this non-invasive intervention addresses central activation dysfunction, a proposed novel concept in neuromuscular disorders that originates from hypotheses derived from clinical observations. This interesting concept requires further exploration to ensure its neurophysiological validation through future studies with larger sample sizes, control groups, and long-term follow-ups, all of which could explore CAD as a therapeutic target.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To examine how frailty influences chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and psychological distress (anxiety and depression) in chemotherapy patients, exploring the mediating role of fatigue and the moderating (protective) role of mindfulness. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey enrolled 445 chemotherapy patients from three tertiary hospitals in China during April 2024-February 2025. Participants completed validated measures including the Treatment-Induced Neuropathy Assessment Scale (TNAS), Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI), Cancer Fatigue Scale (CFS), Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Moderated mediation analyses were conducted using structural equation modeling (SEM) with bootstrap techniques. RESULTS: Frailty significantly predicted higher CIPN symptoms (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.179, 95% CI [0.101, 0.032]) and anxiety/depression (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.216, 95% CI [0.140, 0.289]). Fatigue significantly mediated these relationships, with indirect effects of frailty on CIPN symptoms (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.125, 95% CI [0.081, 0.179], accounting for 41.1% of total effect) and on anxiety/depression (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.116, 95% CI [0.076, 0.163], accounting for 34.9% of total effect). Mindfulness moderated the association between frailty and fatigue (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.106, 95% CI [-0.260, 0.006]) and between frailty and anxiety/depression (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.083, 95% CI [-0.187, -0.005]); however, mindfulness did not significantly moderate fatigue-CIPN pathways (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.022, 95% CI [-0.048, 0.089]). CONCLUSION: Fatigue is a critical mediator linking frailty to CIPN and psychological distress. Mindfulness effectively buffers the negative impacts of frailty on fatigue and psychological distress. Integrating frailty assessment, targeted fatigue management, and mindfulness interventions into clinical practice may enhance symptom management and psychological well-being among chemotherapy patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psychological stress during pregnancy is common and has been associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Digital health interventions (DHIs) have emerged as a scalable approach to support stress management during pregnancy, yet evidence remains fragmented, and prior reviews have largely focused on broad perinatal mental health outcomes or delivery platforms rather than stress-specific effects and targeted intervention components. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of DHIs specifically designed to reduce stress during pregnancy and to examine how intervention strategies and delivery methods are associated with stress outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines. Randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies involving pregnant women were eligible if they evaluated any digitally delivered intervention-such as mobile apps, web-based programs, or telemedicine-intended to reduce stress, and reported validated stress outcomes. We searched CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and PubMed from database inception through November 2025. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool for randomized trials and the risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of interventions tool for nonrandomized studies. Where appropriate, effect sizes were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis with the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method and reported as standardized mean differences. RESULTS: A total of 19 studies were included. Overall, DHIs were associated with a significant reduction in stress compared with control conditions (standardized mean difference -0.45, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.32; 95% prediction interval -0.78 to -0.13), with low to moderate heterogeneity. Strategy-based subgroup analyses indicated that mindfulness- and education-focused interventions showed favorable effects, but formal tests for between-subgroup differences were not statistically significant. Evidence certainty was rated as moderate, primarily due to risk-of-bias concerns in some trials. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides stress-focused evidence that DHIs can support stress reduction during pregnancy and extends existing literature by systematically disaggregating interventions according to delivery methods, functional features, and content strategies. This study offers a component-oriented synthesis that informs the design and selection of digital stress-management interventions for pregnant women. In real-world antenatal care, these tools may complement clinician-delivered services by expanding access to low-intensity, scalable support, particularly when interventions integrate skills-based content with supportive digital functions. Future research should directly compare single versus combined strategies and evaluate implementation across diverse populations and care settings.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), defined as the deliberate, self-inflicted damage of body tissue without suicidal intent, is increasingly prevalent among adolescents and young adults and poses a major public health concern. Current treatments are often costly, difficult to access, and not tailored to the specific needs of young people. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions represent a promising avenue for scalable, accessible, and cost-effective support for NSSI, especially when combined with real-time assessments and personalized treatment strategies. OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effectiveness of Kalmer, a brief app-based intervention for reducing NSSI and improving emotional well-being. The study has 2 aims: (1) to evaluate a newly developed app-based intervention for adolescents and young adults engaging in NSSI and (2) to assess predictors of treatment outcomes for this app-based intervention. We hypothesize that participants receiving a mobile app-based brief intervention specifically tailored to address NSSI will show a greater reduction in NSSI frequency at the end of treatment and at follow-up than participants receiving a nonspecific app-based intervention. In this paper, we present our study protocol. METHODS: This 2-arm randomized controlled trial, lasting 6 weeks, will include 240 participants aged 14 to 24 years who engage in NSSI. The intervention app, Kalmer, was developed through iterative consultation with clinical and research experts and guided by survey results and evidence-based frameworks such as dialectical behavior therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. The intervention will include 5 core components: distress tolerance, emotion regulation, mindfulness and self-compassion, interpersonal regulation, and problem-focused coping. The app will deliver multimedia-based ecological momentary interventions triggered by real-time ecological momentary assessments to tailor support to users' current contexts and needs. Participants are randomized to receive either the Kalmer intervention or a psychoeducational control app. The primary outcome will be NSSI frequency, assessed through self-report at baseline, 6 weeks after intervention, and at 1-month and 3-month follow-ups. RESULTS: Ethics approval was obtained in December 2022. As of January 2026, a total of 145 participants had consented to participate in the study and completed baseline assessments. Preliminary data show high app engagement and acceptability and positive user feedback regarding app usability and content. Recruitment is ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide evidence on the effectiveness of a mobile app-based intervention for NSSI and will explore potential mechanisms of change, supporting the development of accessible digital mental health tools for adolescents and young adults.

      "abstract": "The fields of neurophenomenology, psychoneuroendocrinoimmunology (PNEI) and epigenetics provide innovative and complementary perspectives on understanding the positive effects of art and aesthetic experiences on human well-being and health. Neurophenomenology integrates subjective experiential reports with neuroscientific data, offering valuable insights into how aesthetic experiences elicit positive emotional responses, alleviate stress and enhance cognitive and emotional development. PNEI, by contrast, examines the bidirectional communication among the nervous, endocrine and immune systems, providing the basis for investigating how specific psychological experiences, including positive ones, influence physical health. Epigenetics, in turn, can serve as a bridge between these domains, as the biological translator that connects environmental and experiential factors to gene expression. This paper presents a conceptual perspective as it proposes an integrative framework linking neurophenomenology, PNEI and epigenetics, aimed at elucidating how art and aesthetic experiences can promote health and well-being. By examining the shared mechanisms and pathways across these fields, we aim to outline their collective implications for scientific research, health promotion/disease prevention and clinical applications.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psychogenic erectile dysfunction patients accounted for a substantial percentage of younger erectile dysfunction ones. This cross-sectional observational study investigated the correlation between a history of frequent masturbation and anxiety/depression symptoms in patients with psychogenic erectile dysfunction . RESULTS: Baseline characteristics showed significant between-group differences in age (the Frequent Masturbation History group younger, P\u2009<\u20090.05), but not in disease duration, residence, or lifestyle factors. The Frequent Masturbation History group demonstrated significantly higher anxiety (GAD-7: Z=-2.17, P\u2009=\u20090.030) and depression scores (PHQ-9: Z=-3.01, P\u2009=\u20090.003), alongside significantly lower psychological resilience (CD-RISC: Z=-2.53, P\u2009=\u20090.011) compared to the Non-Frequent Masturbation History group. These findings indicate that frequent masturbation history in psychogenic erectile dysfunction patients is associated with younger age, elevated anxiety/depression symptomatology, and reduced stress adaptability. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical implications suggest incorporating behavioral pattern assessment and psychological screening into psychogenic erectile dysfunction evaluations. Targeted interventions should focus on cognitive-behavioral therapy to address maladaptive beliefs, mindfulness training to reduce performance anxiety, and partner-involved support to disrupt the observed \"masturbation to anxiety/depression to erectile dysfunction\" cycle. Future longitudinal studies integrating biopsychosocial assessments are warranted to elucidate temporal relationships.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Racialized immigrants are disproportionately impacted by HIV in Canada. In 2022, 69.5% of first-time HIV cases, where race and/or ethnicity was reported, were among racialized individuals: Indigenous (22.6%), Black (18.0%), Asian and Arab (16.3%), and Latinx (10.1%). HIV vulnerability in racialized communities is reinforced by HIV stigma intersecting with prejudice and discrimination associated with racism, gendered oppression, homophobia, and economic marginalization. Stigma and discrimination impede public health efforts in HIV prevention, testing, treatment, and care. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study is to reduce HIV-related stigma in racialized immigrant communities in 6 Canadian cities in Alberta (Calgary, Edmonton) and Ontario (London, Niagara, Ottawa, Toronto). We will implement an evidence-based 6-session online intervention, Acceptance and Commitment to Empowerment (ACE), to promote skills for psychological flexibility (mindfulness, acceptance, cognitive defusion, values clarification, and committed action) and collective empowerment (critical reflection, dialogue, interconnectedness, and collective action). The objectives are to (1) assess community contexts and needs to inform the refinement of ACE; (2) build community capacity in stigma reduction; (3) evaluate the facilitators and barriers of implementing stigma reduction programs; and (4) disseminate knowledge to advance research, policy, and practice. METHODS: Guided by the principles of social justice and health equity, we will apply the context-based PRISM (Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model) and outcome-based RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) frameworks to inform the contextual adaptation, implementation, and evaluation of the ACE intervention. In phase 1 (year 1), we aim to survey 12 local organizations on their existing stigma reduction programs; engage 30 service providers and 60 community members to explore the local contexts and needs of stigma reduction. In phase 2 (year 2), phase 1 results will be used to refine the ACE intervention and apply a train-the-trainer (TTT) approach to engage 48 service providers or community leaders in the ACE training. ACE TTT graduates will be mentored to become ACE Community Facilitators. In phase 3 (years 3-4), project staff and ACE Community Facilitators will work in small 3-member teams to deliver the online ACE intervention to qualified participants (n=288) in 6 cities. Mixed methods will be used to examine the contextual factors on implementation processes and intervention effectiveness. Data analyses will include reflexive thematic analysis of qualitative data, inferential statistics, and analyses of variance to determine the effectiveness of the intervention over time. RESULTS: The implementation of project ACE was delayed by 2 years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The requirement of obtaining research ethics approvals from all affiliated universities (n=8) further delayed the launch of research activities involving participants until September 2023. Between October 2023 and August 2024, the project team recruited 8 community leaders from the 6 project sites to form the Project Advisory Committee (PAC), worked with PAC members to identify outreach and recruitment strategies for phase 1, and recruited and secured 19 community organizations as project collaborators for phase 2. As of March 2025, phase 1 data collection has been completed, and data analysis and knowledge translation are underway. CONCLUSIONS: Based on results from previous research, we anticipate generating critical knowledge on the effectiveness of ACE in reducing internalized and enacted stigma through collective empowerment, and the facilitators/barriers in implementing ACE among racialized immigrants in real-world settings.",

      "abstract": "End-user behaviour plays a critical role in addressing environmental challenges through the adoption of sustainable lifestyle practices. Recognising this, marketers and policymakers have increasingly emphasised the importance of identifying the factors that shape individual consumption choices. This study, conducted in India, examines how experiential thinking motivates the users of household appliances to practice sustainable behaviour. Decision-making is viewed through the cognitive experiential self-theory (CEST) framework, which explains how individuals process information before adopting specific consumption patterns, and how mindfulness helps to process intention towards sustainable consumption. A quantitative research design was employed, with data collected from 464 respondents using a structured questionnaire. The analysis, conducted through SPSS 25 and AMOS 25, involved confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), structural equation modelling (SEM), and assessments of convergent and discriminant validity. The results reveal that emotion, experience, and peer influence reflect experiential thinking and process intentions towards sustainable behaviour. Mindfulness acts as a moderator, strengthening the relationship between the two. The study highlights essential implications: marketers can integrate sustainability-related information into product labelling to promote conscious consumption, while policymakers may design targeted strategies to encourage sustainable practices, thereby contributing to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12.",

Despite these challenges, many demonstrate resilience-the capacity to adapt and sustain well-being under adversity. This integrative review synthesizes conceptual frameworks and interventions designed to strengthen family resilience in ASD caregiving. A systematic search across PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and Google Scholar (2000-2025) yielded 55 eligible studies. Seven resilience models were identified: protective factors, transactional, ecological systems, CARE, mindfulness-based stress reduction, Triple-A, and strengths-based approaches. Interventions informed by these models produced measurable benefits, including reductions in parental stress and caregiver burden, alongside gains in family cohesion, psychological health, and quality of life. The review underscores the importance of culturally adapted, multidisciplinary, and scalable resilience-building strategies, while calling for standardized evaluation tools and policy integration to ensure sustainable support for families raising children with ASD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CC) is the third most common cancer globally. Despite advances in treatment, patients often experience long-term psychological, physical, and social challenges during and after treatment. Specialised cancer care, including the role of cancer nurses, is critical in supporting patients throughout their treatment journey. AIMS: This study aimed to explore the experiences of CC patients in Australia in navigating the healthcare system, coping with their diagnosis, and receiving support from specialised cancer nurses and support networks. METHOD: An exploratory qualitative design was used. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine CC patients (seven females, two males), aged 34-72\u00a0years. Interviews were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four overarching themes emerged. First, challenges navigating the healthcare system, identified participants' frustrations with delays, miscommunication, and fragmented care. Second, emotional impact of a CC diagnosis and treatment, captured the shock, fear, and isolation experienced, particularly following sudden diagnoses. Third, value of specialised cancer nurses and support networks, highlighted the emotional reassurance and practical guidance provided by community-based nurses and support services. Fourth, physical and mental coping strategies included participants' use of mindfulness, physical activity, and dietary changes to regain a sense of control. CONCLUSION: Specialised cancer nurses played a crucial role in enhancing patient care by addressing both medical and emotional needs. Improving communication, ensuring continuity of care, and providing personalised support are key recommendations for improving the healthcare experience of CC patients in Australia.",
