      "abstract": "Blockchain technology (BCT) has emerged as a promising solution for ensuring supply chain traceability. However, not all consumers have a comprehensive understanding of the benefits associated with BCT-enabled traceability. In this article, we investigate the impacts of consumer awareness on the adoption of BCT within a supply chain comprising a manufacturer and a retailer. We develop two distinct scenarios: Scenario B, where the supply chain traceability is managed via traditional digital systems, and Scenario E, where the supply chain traceability is managed via BCT-enabled systems. We introduce the concept of consumer traceability awareness level, representing the proportion of the consumer population that is knowledgeable about the advantages of these traceability technologies. The findings reveal that the adoption of BCT enhances the overall performance of the supply chain and makes it more sensitive to the consumer traceability awareness level. Nonetheless, the manufacturer consistently experiences advantages from BCT adoption, whereas the retailer's situation may deteriorate. In both scenarios, a low traceability awareness level prompts the retailer to target all consumers, whereas a high-traceability awareness level shifts its focus solely to the knowledgeable consumers. Intriguingly, the adoption of BCT shifts the retailer's inclination toward targeting the knowledgeable consumers rather than all consumers.",

      "abstract": "Emerging evidence has shown that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is effective in improving depressive symptoms in the older population. However, the accessibility to MBCT is limited by the shortage of psychotherapists or mindfulness teachers. One potential solution is to involve social workers, who have the knowledge and skills to promote individual and community well-being in various settings, in delivering modified MBCT to enhance its accessibility and sustainability. This study examined the effectiveness of an eight-week age-modified MBCT led by different mental health professionals (mindfulness teacher only vs. mindfulness teacher and social worker) in improving mental health outcomes as compared with a control group. Older adults (N\u2009=\u2009112) were recruited through five community-based centres for older adults and mental wellness in Hong Kong. Participants were allocated to one of three groups: (1) mindfulness teacher-led modified MBCT, (2) social worker/teacher co-led modified MBCT (50% led by social workers and 50% led by mindfulness teacher), or (3) control (care as usual). The age-modified MBCT consisted of eight weekly sessions, with age-related modifications including more sitting meditation, shortened duration of each session, and the removal of the retreat. Outcome variables (i.e., depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, perceived stress, and mindfulness) were assessed at baseline (T0), after the intervention (T1), and four weeks after the intervention (T2), through self-reported questionnaires. Linear mixed models were performed while controlling for demographic variables to examine changes in outcome variables between the groups. Participants from the age-modified MBCT intervention groups (teacher-led and social worker/teacher co-led) showed significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms and stress, as well as greater increase in mindful non-reactivity, compared to the control group post-intervention. No significant interaction effect of time and group was found for anxiety and both overall mindfulness and its other facets. The improvements in mental health and mindfulness outcomes post-intervention were not significantly different between the teacher-led and social worker/teacher co-led MCBT groups. Age-modified MBCT is beneficial in managing depressive and stress symptoms and in improving mindful non-reactivity among older adults at risk for depression. The findings support the feasibility and effectiveness of partial task-shifting in the delivery of MBCT to trained social workers. Future studies may explore the possibility for social workers in leading MBCTs independently to further improve its scalability and service accessibility for older adults in the community.

      "abstract": "Introduction About 30% of depressed patients suffer from a protracted course in which the disorder continues to cause significant burden despite treatment efforts. While originally developed for relapse prevention, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has increasingly been investigated in depressed patients with such \u2018difficult-to-treat\u2019 courses. This is a protocol for an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis aiming to determine efficacy and potential moderators of MBCT treatment effects in this group based on evidence from randomised controlled trials. Methods and analysis Systematic searches in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, EMBASE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register for randomised controlled trials were completed on 17 June 2024. Authors of identified studies have contributed IPD, and data extractions have been completed. An update search will be conducted immediately before the start of data analyses. We will investigate the following outcomes: (a) self-reported and observer-reported severity of depression symptomatology, (b) remission and (c) clinically meaningful improvement and deterioration. One-stage and two-stage IPD-MA will be conducted with one-stage models using the observed IPD from all studies simultaneously as the primary approach. One-stage IPD models will include stratified study intercepts and error terms as well as random effects to capture between-study heterogeneity. Moderator analyses will test treatment-covariate interactions for both individual patient-level and study-level characteristics. Ethics and dissemination The results will inform understanding of the use of MBCT in patients with current \u2018difficult-to-treat\u2019 depression and will contribute to arguments in favour of or against implementing MBCT as a treatment for this group. They will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and made available to stakeholders in accessible formats. No local ethical review was necessary following consultation with the Ethics and Governance Board of the University of Surrey. Guidance on patient data storage and management will be adhered to throughout. PROSPERO registration number CRD42022332039.",

Kondisi ini harus berlangsung setidaknya 2 minggu atau lebih dan memengaruhi keberfungsian individu dalam keseharian. Individu yang mengalami gangguan ini biasanya terjebak dalam pemikiran yang negatif dan melakukan ruminasi sehingga terjebak dan kewalahan. Oleh karena itu, digunakan intervensi MBCT untuk menurunkan keparahan gejala depresi dengan praktik teknik mindfulness dan perubahan perilaku. \u00a0Penelitian ini menggunakan metode eksperimen subjek tunggal (Single Case Experiment) untuk mengevaluasi efektivitas MBCT pada wanita berusa 22 tahun yang memenuhi kriteria depresi. Data-data yang berkaitan dikumpulkan dengan wawancara klinis, observasi, dan tes psikologis (DASS-42, SPM, Tes Grafis, dan SSCT). Hasil intervensi menunjukkan adanya penurunan gejala depresi pada partisipan dalam 3 minggu penanganan karena melakukan praktik mindfulness secara rutin dalam kegiatan sehari-hari dan pengaktifan kembali perilaku serta kegiatan positif yang memberikan positive reinforcement pada partisipan. Partisipan kembali berfungsi dalam kehidupannya dan keberhasilan terapi ini juga dipengaruhi oleh motivasi partisipan untuk berubah serta dukungan sosial yang adekuat dari lingkungan di sekitar partisipan.",

This perspective paper examines the application of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy modified for visual symptoms (MBCT-vision) as an intervention for VSS. Drawing on clinical experience, our recent open-label study, and ongoing randomized controlled trial, we propose that VSS symptoms may perpetuate through attentional mechanisms, including heightened vigilance and threat attribution. We outline how mindfulness practices in MBCT-vision address these processes by enhancing attentional flexibility, increasing metacognitive awareness, and fostering a non-reactive stance toward symptoms. The group-based format of MBCT-vision provides additional therapeutic benefits through shared understanding and validation. We discuss potential neuroplastic mechanisms underlying observed improvements, particularly involving the Default Mode Network. This paper advances the understanding of mindfulness mechanisms in VSS and provides a foundation for developing comprehensive, evidence-based approaches that integrate neurobiological insights with person-centered therapeutic strategies for this challenging condition.",

To address this, we created MBCT for Depression-Taking it Further (MBCT-D-TiF). Objective To refine and pilot test feasibility and acceptability of MBCT-D-TiF. Methods We collected qualitative focus group data to inform refinements and quantitative data to pilot test feasibility and acceptability of MBCT-D-TiF. In round one, participants received MBCT-D-TiF (n = 14), consisting of 4 weekly and then monthly sessions delivered via group videoconferencing. In round two (n = 20), participants were randomized 1:1 to MBCT-D-TiF or waitlist control. Surveys were completed at baseline, 1 and 4 months by all participants. We explored participants\u2019 experiences with MBCT-D-TiF in two focus groups (n = 7 in each) conducted via videoconferencing. We used descriptive statistics and mixed linear models to analyze quantitative data and thematic content analysis to analyze qualitative data. Results MBCT-D-TiF participants (n = 25) attended all weekly sessions (100%) and at least 75% of the monthly sessions (76%); found the weekly sessions very or extremely helpful (77.1%), and the monthly sessions very or extremely helpful (66.7%). The following themes emerged: (1) the importance of the group for participants\u2019 social connection, support, and practice community that enhanced their meditative experience, helped improve their mental health, and facilitated accountability; (2) MBCT-D-TiF provided mental health benefits, including tools to lessen the negative impact of depression and anxiety, increase connections to the world, and enhance positive experiences; (3) participants\u2019 home practices were reinvigorated during the weekly MBCT-D-TiF sessions, but fell short of their goals thereafter. Conclusion MBCT-D-TiF was well attended and rated very or extremely helpful by most participants, supporting its feasibility and acceptability. Qualitative data showed that additional steps to help participants sustain home practice are needed, offering a target for refinement and further testing.",

      "abstract": "Remaja merupakan masa peralihan dari masa anak-anak dan masa dewasa. Depresi pada remaja bukan sekadar perasaan sedih atau stres biasa, melainkan kondisi serius yang permanen dan memengaruhi perilaku, emosi, serta cara berpikir mereka. MBCT dapat melatih remaja mengembangkan metacognitive awareness, yaitu kemampuan untuk mengamati pikiran sebagai peristiwa mental yang sementara, bukan sebagai kebenaran mutlak. Melalui latihan mindfulness, remaja belajar untuk menjadi \"pengamat\" emosi mereka, menciptakan ruang antara diri mereka dan pengalaman emosional, yang memungkinkan respons yang lebih fleksibel dan adaptif. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui efektivitas MBCT dalam menurunkan gejala depresi pada remaja. Penelitian ini bersifat kuantitatif dan kualitatif dalam menentukan efektivitas MBCT terhadap depresi pada remaja. Sebanyak 4 subjek dalam penelitian ini diwawancara, dinilai dengan skor BDI-II (Beck Depression Inventory) sebelum dan setelah diberikan MBCT. Analisis pada penelitian ini menggunakan analisis non-parametrik dikarenakan subjek yang diteliti hanya 4 orang. Berdasarkan analisis wilcoxon didapatkan hasil tidak signifikan dengan p=0.066, namun dengan besar efek -0.92 yang menandakan adanya efek yang besar dalam penurunan gejala depresi dengan MBCT. Hasil ini ditunjang dengan adanya peningkatan pemahaman remaja terkait depresi dan konsep mindfulness serta peningkatan remaja terkait aplikasi koping emosi yang adaptif.\u00a0",

Methods The intervention included weekly online sessions and mindfulness audio guides. Pre- and post-assessments used the EPDS, TFMQ, PES-Brief, and MWMS. No control group was included. Results Depression scores moderately decreased (Cohen\u2019s d = 0.46). Improvements were seen in mindfulness (non-reactivity, non-judgment), and external motivation reduced from 19.25 to 15.50 (Cohen\u2019s d = 0.34), indicating increased autonomous motivation. Conclusion Digital MBCT is feasible and may reduce depressive symptoms while enhancing self-determined work motivation. Findings are preliminary; larger, controlled studies are needed to confirm efficacy.",

The present research is applied in nature and employs a quasi-experimental design with pre-test, post-test, follow-up, and a control group. The statistical population of this study consists of all mothers of children with autism in the city of Rasht who visited the Gilan Autism Support Charity in 2023. A sample of 30 participants was purposefully selected. The intervention consisted of eight 90-minute sessions of MBCT training conducted in groups, twice a week, based on the method of Kabat-Zinn (2003). To collect data, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (2003), the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (1989), and the McLain Ambiguity Tolerance Scale (2009) were used. Data were analyzed using SPSS software. The results indicated that the MBCT intervention led to an increase in resilience and happiness scores in mothers of children with autism, but no improvement was observed in ambiguity tolerance scores. Given that resilience skills can be learned and that psychological interventions, including MBCT, can improve resilience by reducing negative emotions and fostering positive emotions, MBCT, through combining vitality and clear perception of experiences, can create positive changes in happiness.",

      "abstract": "Depressive disorder is one of the most prevalent mental health problems with a significant impact on quality of life. In Indonesia, the 2018 National Health Survey (Riskesdas) reported a prevalence of depression among adolescents at 6.2%, with risk increasing along with age. The high relapse rate makes depression a chronic condition that requires long-term intervention strategies. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has emerged as an evidence-based intervention that integrates cognitive-behavioral therapy with mindfulness practices to help individuals disengage from ruminative thought patterns. This article aims to review empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of MBCT in reducing depressive symptoms and preventing relapse. The method employed is a narrative review of scientific articles published between 2000 and 2020, encompassing randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental studies, case studies, and meta-analyses. Data collection was carried out by examining documentation from previous studies through database searches such as Google Scholar, Sinta, Science Direct, and Taylor & Francis. The review findings indicate that MBCT is effective in reducing depression, anxiety, and rumination, improving quality of life and self-compassion, and demonstrates comparable effectiveness to conventional cognitive therapy and pharmacotherapy in preventing relapse. These findings strengthen MBCT\u2019s position as a clinical and preventive intervention with potential for implementation in mental health services in Indonesia.",

      "abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of CBM and MBCT in reducing cognitive avoidance and negative self-talk in students with social anxiety disorder.\n\nMethods and Materials: A quasi-experimental pre-test\u2013post-test control group design was employed, using 60 students diagnosed with social anxiety disorder selected from Farhangian University (Shiraz, 2022\u201323). The students were randomly assigned to three groups (CBM, MBCT, and control; n = 20 per group). The CBM group received seven 90-minute sessions, and the MBCT group received eight sessions. The Social Anxiety Questionnaire (Connor et al., 2000), Cognitive Avoidance Questionnaire (Sexton & Dugas, 2004), and Self-Talk Scale (Calvete et al., 2005) were administered. Data were analyzed using ANCOVA and Bonferroni post hoc tests.\n\nFindings: Both interventions significantly reduced cognitive avoidance and negative self-talk compared to the control group (p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in effectiveness between CBM and MBCT. The largest effect sizes were observed in the reduction of total cognitive avoidance (\u03b7\u00b2 = .54) and negative self-talk (\u03b7\u00b2 = .63).\n\nConclusion: CBM and MBCT are equally effective interventions for reducing maladaptive cognitive patterns in students with social anxiety. These findings suggest that both approaches may be valuable tools for university counseling centers aiming to address anxiety-related cognitive distortions.",

      "abstract": "Periode perinatal merupakan fase yang rentan terjadi perubahan emosional dan fisik yang berdampak signifikan pada kesehatan mental ibu hamil, khususnya kecemasan. Kehamilan risiko tinggi meningkatkan ibu mengalami kecemasan yang dapat memberikan dampak negatif bagi ibu dan janin. Penelitian ini bertujuan mengkaji efektivitas Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) Prenatal dalam menurunkan tingkat kecemasan pada ibu hamil risiko tinggi. Penelitian menggunakan desain quasi-eksperimen dengan one group pretest-posttest, melibatkan 46 ibu hamil resiko tinggi dengan usia kehamilan 22\u201340 minggu dan memiliki tingkat kecemasan sedang hingga berat. MBCT diberikan selama tiga sesi dalam satu minggu, dengan pengukuran kecemasan menggunakan Perinatal Anxiety Screening Scale (PASS) pada pretest, posttest, dan follow-up 14 hari setelahnya. Hasil menunjukkan terjadi penurunan signifikan skor kecemasan dari rata-rata 5,24 \u00b1 1,29 menjadi 3,78 \u00b1 1,05 setelah intervensi (p = 0,001). Sebelum perlakuan, 50% responden mengalami kecemasan berat, namun setelah perlakuan mayoritas (78,3%) berkurang ke tingkat kecemasan ringan. Hasil ini mendukung efektivitas MBCT sebagai intervensi non-farmakologis yang aman dan adaptif dalam mengelola kecemasan pada ibu hamil risiko tinggi. MBCT membantu regulasi emosi dan meningkatkan kesadaran penuh sehingga mengurangi respon berlebihan terhadap stres. Studi ini memberikan kontribusi bagi praktik pelayanan kesehatan maternal dalam penanganan kesehatan mental ibu hamil melalui pendekatan mindfulness yang terintegrasi.",

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Psychological distress is a pervasive yet often undertreated aspect of the cancer experience, contributing to reduced quality of life, poorer treatment adherence, and worse health outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy of non-pharmacological, evidence-based psychological interventions on distress, depression, anxiety, coping capacity, and quality of life in adult cancer patients. Interventions were grouped into three domains: structured psychotherapeutic therapies (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [CBT], Acceptance and Commitment Therapy [ACT], Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy [MCP]); mindfulness and stress reduction programs (e.g., Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction [MBSR], Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy [MBCT]); and coping and resilience-enhancing modalities (e.g., Promoting Resilience in Stress Management [PRISM], expressive writing). Materials and Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, 42 randomized controlled trials published between 2015 and 2025 were included. A stratified meta-analytic approach calculated pooled standardized mean differences for each intervention class and outcome. Heterogeneity, subgroup, and moderator analyses explored drivers of effect variability. Results: Structured psychotherapeutic interventions yielded the largest effects, especially for depression. Mindfulness-based interventions produced moderate but significant improvements in distress and emotional regulation. Coping and resilience programs provided smaller yet statistically significant gains in adaptive coping. Between-study heterogeneity was moderate, partly explained by intervention type, delivery modality, and cancer subtype. Conclusions: These findings support integrating psychosocial care into standard oncology protocols and endorse its routine implementation as a core component of comprehensive cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "This article explores the potential relevance of Mindfulness-Based Programs, particularly Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), to support the mission of higher education by facilitating the journey from information to knowledge, and from knowledge to wisdom. It thus addresses the problems of distractibility and superficial engagement caused by information overload and aims to prepare students for a fulfilling life. Based upon an in-depth dialogue among authors belonging to different disciplines, this conceptual synthesis integrates the various perspectives of Buddhist studies, philosophy of education, anthropology of education, clinical psychology, and psychiatry, to construct a comprehensive view of mindfulness for higher education. The structure of its argument progresses from the languishing to the flourishing of students, and from mindfulness taught in the form of interventions, to mindfulness cultivated as the very thread of learning. The article starts by reviewing the evidence regarding students\u2019 mental health and vulnerabilities, and moves to directly listening to their voices, larger aspirations, and more existential concerns. It next elaborates an epistemic and developmental model of mindful education, making creative use of T. S. Eliot\u2019s questions regarding information, knowledge, wisdom, and Life, to capture some ongoing, complex issues. MBCT\u2019s principles, formats, practices, and adaptations are then examined to envision skillful responses to these perceived challenges, with a proposal to further weave mindfulness into the constitution of higher education. Ultimately, in reference to Simone Weil, mindfulness training is conceived as guiding the \u201cformation of attention,\u201d along the \u201cjoy of learning,\u201d to accomplish two interrelated humanistic ideals: academic excellence and human flourishing.",

      "abstract": "Introduction The birth and admission of a premature infant to the NICU is often an unexpected experience and a mental and spiritual challenge for families. Spiritual health is an influential factor affecting how a mother faces and endures a stressful situation. Improving the mother's spiritual health requires cognitive therapy approaches, including mindfulness techniques. Nurses can help mothers of infants admitted to the NICU to go through the hospitalization period more peacefully by using mindfulness techniques. To this end, the present study sought to investigate the effect of a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) program on spiritual health in mothers of infants admitted to the NICU. Methods This quasi-experimental study was conducted using a pre-test-post-test design in two intervention and control groups. The participants were 50 mothers of infants admitted to the NICU of Afzalipur Hospital, Kerman, who were selected via convenience sampling and randomly divided into two control and intervention groups (25 mothers in each group). The intervention involved providing counseling using a short-term mindfulness-based cognitive therapy program carried out in four 2-h sessions for the participants in the intervention group. The participants in the control group received routine NICU care. The participants in both groups completed a demographic information questionnaire and the Spiritual WellBeing Scale (SWBS) before and after the intervention. The collected data were analyzed with SPSS-25 software. Results The data showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of demographic characteristics (P > 0.05). Moreover, the mean score of spiritual health in the intervention group was 92.80 \u00b1 12.14 and that of the control group was 92.16 \u00b1 16.35 before the intervention. The mean score of spiritual health in the intervention group was 104.04 \u00b1 6.60 and that of the control group was 92.56 \u00b1 16.35 after the intervention. The results of the paired samples t-test revealed a statistically significant difference in the mean scores of spiritual health and its dimensions before and after the intervention in the intervention group (P < 0.001). Discussion The findings from the present study indicated that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy intervention was effective in improving the spiritual health of mothers with infants admitted to the NICU. NICU nurses can use mindfulness-based cognitive therapy as a practical intervention to improve the spiritual health of mothers of premature infants and promote the sense of meaningfulness and meaning of life in these mothers.",

      "abstract": "Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is an experiential group intervention adapted from Buddhist meditational practice aimed at treating recurrent depression. Our scoping review explored the MBCT effectiveness in multicultural settings and whether any adaptations were made to enhance it. By using Arksey and O\u2019Malley's framework, our review examined randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2010 and 2023, focusing solely on studies from non-English speaking countries. Out of 1461 published RCT, only 15 of them met our study criteria and they were mainly from China, Denmark, Germany, Hong Kong, Iran, Netherlands, and Switzerland. Out of 15 selected RCT publications, 10 studies shown that MBCT significantly improved symptom-based measures (e.g., Beck Depression Inventory-II), one study shown little difference between MBCT compared to Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), and four studies shown that comparative treatments were more effective than MBCT, in which two of them were culturally specific interventions, Traditional Yoga and Qigong. Two studies found MBCT effective when combined with Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Loving-kindness meditation. Common themes including (1) reduction in psychological distress across all studies, (2) trials used small sample sizes, and (3) the feasibility of using MBCT in multicultural settings, with cultural interventions showing greater effectiveness. MBCT interventions reported promising results when used in a multicultural setting, with a potential for culturally integrated intervention. Our results conclude an opportunity for future research to embed psycho-spirituality with MBCT.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Many patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suffer from psychological distress, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and a reduced quality of life\u2014even during remission. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has been effective in other populations, and therefore it may also benefit IBD patients. The primary objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of MBCT plus treatment as usual (TAU) in reducing psychological distress compared to TAU alone. Methods This multicenter randomized controlled trial study included IBD patients in remission, aged 16 and older, who experienced at least mild levels of psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale\u2005\u2265\u200511). Assessments were conducted at baseline, post-intervention (3 months), and at 6, 9, and 12 months after baseline. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04646785. Results A total of 142 participants were allocated to MBCT\u2005+\u2005TAU (n\u2005=\u200570) or TAU alone (n\u2005=\u200572). Group-delivered MBCT significantly reduced psychological distress (d\u2005=\u2005\u22120.61) and improved well-being (d\u2005=\u20050.40) post-intervention, with consolidation of the effects over time. Exploratory objective sleep metrics (ie, electroencephalography) showed a reduction in total sleep time (d\u2005=\u20050.67) after MBCT with an increase in the proportion of deep sleep (d\u2005=\u20050.70). While flare occurrence showed no difference, fecal calprotectin levels reduced in the MBCT\u2005+\u2005TAU group over the follow-up period (d\u2005=\u2005\u22120.49). Conclusions Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy can be considered a valuable addition to the limited effective psychosocial interventions set for IBD patients, as it reduces psychological distress and improves well-being. This study also shows the possible impact of MBCT on biological processes, such as sleep and inflammation.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Providing a balanced training stimulus that promotes positive adaptations without excessively increasing training volume\u2014and thereby avoiding disruptions to the training process\u2014is a challenging task for strength and conditioning coaches. This study aimed to compare the effects of one vs. two weekly sessions of upper limb plyometric training (ULPT) on muscle strength, power, and serve velocity in male youth tennis players. Methods We conducted a randomized controlled study with two ULPT groups: one receiving one session weekly (ULPT1w) and the other two sessions (ULPT2w), alongside a control group maintaining regular tennis training. The intervention lasted 8\u202fweeks. A total of 47 male youth tennis players (15.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.9\u202fyears), competing at the trained/developmental level, participated in the study. Evaluations were conducted twice\u2014once before the intervention and once after\u2014assessing isometric shoulder rotation strength (internal [ISRT] and external [ESRT]) with a dynamometer, the medicine ball chest throw (MBCT), seated shot-put test (SST), and serve velocity using a radar gun. Results In the post-intervention, significant differences were observed between groups for the variables of ISRT (p\u202f=\u202f0.010; \u03b7p2 \u202f=\u202f0.189), ESRT (p\u202f=\u202f0.004; \u03b7p2 \u202f=\u202f0.226), MBCT (p\u202f=\u202f0.012; \u03b7p2 \u202f=\u202f0.181), SST (p\u202f=\u202f0.019; \u03b7p2 \u202f=\u202f0.164), and tennis serve velocity (p\u202f=\u202f0.004; \u03b7p2 \u202f=\u202f0.226). Conclusion The study found that ULPT significantly improves upper limb muscle strength, power, and serve velocity in young male tennis players, with both once and twice weekly training yielding similar benefits. As practical implications coaches can effectively incorporate ULPT once a week to enhance physical performance in young male tennis players.",

      "abstract": "The effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) on rumination has been reviewed; however, the findings remain inconclusive. The present research will systematically evaluate the effectiveness of MBCT on rumination and related psychological indicators. We searched the Cochrane Library, EBSCO, Embase, LILACS, PubMed, Web of Science, China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, and China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP) for all available records up until December 2024 to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining MBCT on rumination. Rumination scores served as the primary outcome, and the mindfulness, self-compassion, decentering, depression, and anxiety scores served as the secondary outcomes. RevMan and Stata software were applied for data processing. Twenty-nine RCTs comprising 2535 subjects were ultimately selected for analysis. The results revealed that MBCT significantly reduced rumination (SMD = -0.51, 95% CI = [-0.64, -0.39], z\u2009=\u20098.30, P\u2009<\u20090.001), with sustained effectiveness during the follow-up period (SMD = -0.61, 95% CI = [-0.89, -0.32], z\u2009=\u20094.21, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Additionally, we also discovered that MBCT had significant effectiveness on mindfulness (SMD\u2009=\u20090.55, 95% CI = [0.46, 0.63], z\u2009=\u200912.04, P\u2009<\u20090.001), self-compassion (SMD\u2009=\u20090.59, 95% CI = [0.22, 0.96], z\u2009=\u20093.15, P\u2009=\u20090.002), decentering (SMD\u2009=\u20090.62, 95% CI = [0.45, 0.78], z\u2009=\u20097.24, P\u2009<\u20090.001), depressive (SMD = -0.57, 95% CI = [-0.79, -0.34], z\u2009=\u20094.95, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and anxiety symptoms (SMD = -0.37, 95% CI = [-0.56, -0.18], z\u2009=\u20093.78, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Funnel plot analysis and Egger\u2019s statistical test did not reveal any significant publication bias (t = -1.47, P\u2009=\u20090.154, 95% CI = [-2.20,0.37]). The present findings confirm the feasibility of MBCT in diminishing rumination and enhancing related psychological indicators. Furthermore, these effects were sustained throughout the follow-up period.",

      "abstract": "This review explores an innovative, integrative therapeutic approach that combines probiotics, prebiotics, and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) to target the dysregulation of the gut\u2013brain axis in schizophrenia. The rationale for this combined strategy is rooted in the overlapping mechanisms by which both biological and psychosocial interventions influence neurophysiological processes. Probiotics and prebiotics are shown to rebalance the gut microbiota, thereby enhancing the synthesis of key neurotransmitters\u2014such as serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and dopamine\u2014and reducing systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. In parallel, MBIs, including Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), promote improvements in emotional regulation, cognitive function, and neuroplasticity through the modulation of neurophysiological pathways, notably by attenuating amygdala reactivity and heightening prefrontal cortex engagement. \nViewing these interventions through the unifying lens of the gut\u2013brain axis presents a promising paradigm: both modalities may exert synergistic effects to support the management of persistent symptoms of schizophrenia and complement existing therapeutic approaches. By converging on shared biological and psychosocial pathways, this integrative model could offer a more comprehensive strategy for addressing the multifaceted challenges of schizophrenia. While preliminary evidence is encouraging, further controlled clinical studies are essential to determine optimal treatment protocols and to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which these therapies interact to enhance patient outcomes.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The research method was a three-stage, three-group semiexperimental design. To this end, the statistical population including all the employees who worked in the technical departments of Tam Kar Company in Isfahan and in terms of the level of stress in middle and higher levels, using purposive sampling, 60 employees were selected and randomly divided into three groups (20 for each group). Geldard (1989) burnout inventory (GBI) was used for data collection. Experimental group 1 received eight 90-min sessions of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy training, and experimental group 2 received job stress coping training in ten 90-min sessions. Repeated measurement ANOVA was used to analyze the data with the help of a statistical software package in social sciences (SPSS) version 22. RESULTS: The results showed that coping with job stress training and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy were equally effective in reducing the employees\u2019 burnout (P \u2264 0.05) and this effect continued at follow-up. CONCLUSION: Given the high prevalence of burnout and psychopathologic symptoms among industry staff, coping with job stress training and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy training can be suggested to reduce burnout syndrome in the industry.",

      "abstract": "Background\nNeural activity and subjective experiences indicate that breath-awareness practices, which focus on mindful observation of breath, promote tranquil calm and thoughtless awareness.\n\n\nPurpose\nThis study explores the impact of tristage \u0100n\u0101p\u0101nasati-based breath meditation on electroencephalography (EEG) oscillations and self-reported mindfulness states in novice meditators following a period of effortful cognition.\n\n\nMethods\nEighty-nine novice meditators (82 males; Mean Age = 24.59 years) underwent a breath-based meditation intervention consisting of three stages: Resting State (RS), Breath Counting (BC), and Breath Focus (BF). EEG assessed neural oscillatory changes throughout the three stages while providing spectral indices for arousal and cognitive workload (CWL) stagewise. State mindfulness and breath awareness-related self-reported feedback were also collected using the Amsterdam Resting-State Questionnaire (ARSQ) post-BF stage and the curated Breath Count Feedback (BCF) post-BC stage, respectively. The internal reliability and construct validity of the standardised ARSQ and the designed BCF were satisfactorily computed within our sample. A within-subjects cross-sectional neurobehavioural examination of the breath self-regulatory novice experiences was thus conducted.\n\n\nResults\nThe breath-based intervention significantly increased alpha power across all stages, indicating relaxation. Theta and delta powers increased during BC and BF in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), suggesting enhanced working memory and focused attention. Gamma power in meditation-associated brain regions and occipital beta oscillations showed significant positive correlations with breath counts, reflecting improved visual and attentional concentration. Lower pre-meditative arousal and smaller in-meditation CWL levels were associated with fewer distractions and increased confidence accuracy during BC.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe results suggest that BC may serve as a valuable tool for improving present-centric control and concentration, highlighting the importance of managing CWL and arousal levels to optimise meditation outcomes.",

      "abstract": "\n\nCancer and its treatments often disrupt cardiovascular health, leading to fluctuations in heart rate and blood pressure (BP). High stress levels in cancer patients can worsen these issues. Breath Awareness Mindfulness Meditation (BAMM) has emerged as a potential intervention to reduce stress and improve cardiovascular outcomes. However, despite its recognised benefits for general cardiovascular health, the effects of BAMM on heart rate and BP in cancer patients have not been extensively studied. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of BAMM in managing cardiovascular parameters in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy.\n\n\n\nThis study employed a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest control group design. Twenty stage II or III cancer patients were purposively sampled and randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. The intervention group practised breath awareness and mindfulness meditation three times a week for four weeks. The study collected sociodemographic data, including age, gender, and education level, as well as clinical data such as cancer stage, treatment type, and duration of illness. Pretest and three post-intervention heart rate (HR) measurements and blood pressure (BP) were taken. Statistical analysis involved repeated measures ANOVA and paired t-tests, with significance set at p < 0.05.\n\n\n\nThe sample had a mean age of 52.6 years, and 60% of participants were female. Most patients (70%) were receiving chemotherapy. Regarding clinical characteristics, 65% were in Stage II cancer, while 35% were in Stage III. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in heart rate (F=21.42, p<0.001), systolic blood pressure (F=29.84, p<0.001), and diastolic blood pressure (F=19.90, p<0.001) over the 30 days. In contrast, the control group exhibited minimal and non-significant changes, with a slight increase in systolic blood pressure (F=6.81, p=0.01). When the intervention group was stratified by age and gender, improvements in cardiovascular outcomes were consistent, regardless of demographic or clinical variations.\n\n\n\nBreath Awareness Mindfulness Meditation (BAMM) is a promising intervention for reducing heart rate and blood pressure in cancer patients, independent of sociodemographic or clinical factors. This supports its potential role in addressing the cardiovascular side effects associated with cancer treatment.\n",

      "abstract": "Background and objective Breath-holding spells (BHS) are common in infants and young children, often triggered by emotional factors like anger or frustration. While their exact cause remains unknown, potential causative factors include iron deficiency and delayed brain development. Despite their frequency, many parents lack proper awareness and understanding of BHS. This study assessed parental knowledge and awareness of BHS among Saudi Arabian parents of infants and toddlers. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online questionnaire from November 1, 2023, to April 30, 2024. Participants were Saudi Arabian adults with at least one child. The questionnaire was validated for reliability and validity. Data were collected on sociodemographic characteristics, parental knowledge of BHS, and experiences with the condition. Data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 24.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY), with Chi-square tests employed to assess relationships between variables. Ethical approval was obtained, and informed consent was acquired from all participants. Results A total of 251 participants were included; while most parents were female and well-educated, many lacked awareness of BHS. Emotional triggers were common causes, and inappropriate responses, such as shaking, occurred frequently. Around a quarter of parents reported experiencing BHS with their children. Knowledge regarding BHS was significantly higher among those parents who had firsthand experience with BHS or those with older children. Conclusions Parents in our sampled cohort had limited knowledge and awareness of BHS. Many parents lack a proper understanding of appropriate management strategies and often resort to harmful practices. These findings emphasize the need for targeted educational interventions to improve parental knowledge and promote safe and effective management of BHS.",

      "abstract": "Objective measurement of mindfulness could help us understand the mechanisms of meditation interventions and how individuals vary in their disposition to be mindful. One proposed measure is the breath\u2010counting task (BCT), which measures how accurately one can count cycles of their breath. Breath counting, which involves sustained attention, meta\u2010awareness, and an internal locus of attention, has been shown in adults to be related to measures of mindfulness even when controlling for established attentional measures. In this study, we test the psychometrics of the BCT in a convenience sample of 78 adolescents with elevated rumination. In preregistered analyses, we related breath\u2010counting measures, including novel objective respiration measures, to a suite of self\u2010report measures as well as the sustained attention to response task (SART). While breath\u2010counting performance showed fair split\u2010half reliability and similar distributions to studies in adults, it did not show the expected positive associations with self\u2010reported mindfulness measures (neither trait nor EMA). Surprisingly, breath\u2010counting accuracy showed negative correlations with a subscale measuring observing of emotions and body sensations, negative correlations with nonreactivity, and performance decrements were larger for individuals scoring more highly on mindfulness in general. The SART showed a small negative correlation with breath\u2010counting resets (an index of mind\u2010wandering). Finally, breath\u2010counting performance was not related to other theoretically relevant clinical, personality, and executive functioning criteria. Our results suggest that, at least in ruminative adolescents, breath\u2010counting may measure a very narrow, contextual form of sustained attention, may not capture other qualities of mindfulness, and may lack predictive validity.",

      "abstract": "Recent calls for mindfulness measures beyond self-report abound, especially for children. Because breath awareness is central to many mindfulness practices, the breath counting task has been proposed as a behavioral measure of mindfulness for adults. In the current study, we investigated whether the breath counting task can also serve as a valid behavioral measure of children\u2019s mindfulness. We examined psychometric properties across breath counting, three established mindfulness questionnaires, and a behavioral cognitive control measure in a sample of 109 children ages 9\u201313\u202fyears. We also offered 1\u20132\u202fweeks of audio-based mindfulness training to a subset of children (n\u202f= 67) who completed daily breathing exercises, then reassessed their breath counting and self-reported mindfulness. In the full sample, children\u2019s breath counting showed psychometric properties and patterns similar to those of adults, was positively associated with overall cognitive control performance, but was unrelated to their self-reported mindfulness (p\u2019s\u202f>\u202f0.24). However, breath counting did improve following training amongst the subset of children who completed 1\u20132\u202fweeks of daily mindfulness exercises (p\u202f<\u202f0.001, \u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.23), whereas self-reported mindfulness did not (p\u202f=\u202f0.44). Our findings suggest that the breath counting task captures aspects of mindfulness separate from those measured by children\u2019s self-reports, and may be more sensitive to training impacts. We recommend the use of both self-report and behavioral measures of mindfulness, like the breath counting task, in future work.",

First, we conduct a user study to collect the breath dataset from 16 amateur singers using a custom wearable breath band. Next, we analyze and evaluate the multi-site respiratory data across four conditions (rest, deep, pitch, and song breath). The initial results show that pitch tasks elicit stronger ribcage expansion while song tasks naturally encourage abdominal engagement. Building on these insights, we design a Mixed Reality (MR) system that visualizes real-time breath using particle-based feedback to enhance somatic awareness. We position singing breath as an engaging and embodied alternative to conventional breathing training and propose directions for breath-aware augmentation that combine biosensing, MR, and affective self-regulation.",

And, it's not just what is said, but how it's said, that influences students. Yet, few (current or future) teachers receive education on vocal pedagogy. Aims This study examined the impact of raising vocal awareness in teachers on their voice production through delivering a voice training program. Method Specifically, we explored how primary school teacher trainees produced motivational (either soft, warm, and encouraging, or harsh, pressuring, and controlling) and neutral communications before and after the delivery of a voice education program that concentrated on raising voice awareness, vocal anatomy, exercise techniques (e.g. breath control, voice modulation), and voice care. Hypotheses: We hypothesised that trainees' voice production would change over the course of the program and lead to more \u2018prototypical\u2019 displays of motivational prosody (e.g. softly spoken encouraging intentions vs. harshly spoken controlling intentions). Results Results indicated a noticeable difference when communicating motivational intentions between pre\u2010 and post\u2010training voice samples: post training, trainees spoke more slowly and with reduced vocal effort irrespective of motivational intention, suggesting that raising vocal awareness can alter classroom communications. Conclusion The results underscore the importance of vocal awareness training to create a supportive and autonomy\u2010enhancing learning environment.",

      "abstract": "Halitosis, or bad breath, significantly affects social and psychological well-being and is often caused by intraoral factors. Dentists play a key role in the diagnosis and treatment of halitosis, but inadequate education may lead to ineffective patient care. This study examines the levels of knowledge and awareness of halitosis among undergraduate dental students. This study employed a cross-sectional design and used an online questionnaire that was developed via Google Forms. The questionnaire was distributed to a convenience sample of 250 undergraduate students from two different dentistry faculties who had completed their clinical internships. All the statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows 11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Responses to the questionnaire were compared between groups using the Pearson chi-square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test. The correct answer scores were compared between groups via the Mann\u2012Whitney U test. There was a significant difference in the degree of attention devoted to halitosis between X University and Y University (p\u2009<\u20090.05). When asked, \u201cHave you ever treated patients with halitosis? \u201c, 28.5% of fourth-year students and 60.5% of fifth-year students answered affirmatively, indicating a statistically significant difference (p\u2009<\u20090.001). There was no significant difference in the number of correct answers between fourth- and fifth-year students (U\u2009=\u20097714.00, p\u2009=\u20090.886). There was a significant difference in the number of correct answers between the universities (U\u2009=\u20095817.50, p\u2009=\u20090.001). The number of correct answers of X University students was slightly higher than that of Y University students. These results support the importance of developing training programs to improve dentists\u2019 self-confidence, social skills, and communication skills, thereby enhancing the diagnosis and treatment of halitosis. A manual for the diagnosis and treatment of halitosis could be helpful for improving dentists\u2019 attitudes and behaviours and for promoting optimal oral health.",

      "abstract": "The atmosphere may constitute the Earth's largest microbial ecosystem, yet it remains the least understood. While microorganisms can persist and may even thrive in the polyextremes of the Earth's atmosphere, it is still unknown whether the atmosphere sustains an active microbial community. Despite growing awareness of the role of the aeromicrobiome in shaping global biogeography, epidemiology, and climate, fundamental questions about its metabolic activity and ecological significance remain unanswered. Here, we outline how theoretical approaches and numerical modeling tools provide powerful avenues to investigate the atmospheric microbial ecosystem, offering unique insights that complement experimental and observational\u2010based studies and can overcome many of the challenges they face. We consider frameworks that integrate (a) theoretical considerations for microbial metabolism across a range of catabolic and anabolic processes, (b) microbial physiology and metabolic states, (c) thermodynamics and bioenergetics, (d) the chemical and physical conditions of the atmosphere and bioaerosols, (e) transport and residence time of microorganisms, and (f) bottom\u2010up and top\u2010down approaches. Theory and modeling\u2010based investigations into the aeromicrobiome can generate and test theory and model\u2010informed hypotheses, formulate mechanistic explanations of biological processes and observations, and inform targeted sampling strategies and experimentation. Together, these approaches bring us closer to determining whether the Earth's atmosphere is a true ecosystem\u2014that is, a metabolically active community of organisms interacting with each other and with the environment. Advances in aeromicrobiology research brought about by theory and modeling can reveal significant insights into global biogeography, biogeochemical cycles, climate processes, and the limits for life.",

      "abstract": "The preservation of local culture is a crucial aspect in safeguarding national identity amidst the currents of globalization. One form of Javanese culture that holds high historical and philosophical value is macapat, a traditional form of singing that conveys moral, ethical, and spiritual teachings. This community service project aims to develop the skills of the younger generation and foster their love for Javanese art and culture through macapat singing training, while also establishing a well-structured and sustainable organization for the Ngesti Laras Art Group in Tulungagung. The method used is a descriptive qualitative approach with data collection techniques including observation, interviews, and documentation. The results show that the macapat training not only enhanced the musical skills of the participants but also raised their awareness of the importance of preserving cultural heritage. Participants experienced significant improvement in understanding and performing macapat songs, supported by the training module provided. Additionally, the formation of an organizational structure consisting of a chairperson, secretary, treasurer, and work divisions provided clear direction and defined roles in managing the group's activities. The recommendation from this initiative is for similar training programs to be conducted continuously, involving more youth and support from educational institutions or local governments, so that local cultural preservation can be carried out more systematically and sustainably. This training serves as a means of regenerating traditional art practitioners and strengthening the cultural identity of the local community. In conclusion, macapat training is an effective strategy for preserving Javanese culture, particularly within local art communities.",

      "abstract": "\n e23231\n \n \n Background:\n Lung Cancer is by far the leading cause of cancer death, making up almost 25% of all cancer deaths. Shockingly, each year more people die of lung cancer than colon, breast, and prostate cancers combined. Due to the late diagnosis, usually in the metastatic phase, the mortality is poor with more than half of patients dying within one year of diagnosis. Texas is 43rd in the nation in diagnosing lung cancer at an early stage. On a national level, approximately 5.8% of patients at high risk for lung cancer are screened, while in Texas, only 1.8% of all high-risk patients undergo screening. Furthermore, in East Texas, the rates of smoking and lung cancer are the highest in the entire state of Texas. In this quality improvement project, we sought to improve rates of lung cancer screening by raising awareness about the significance of lung cancer, addressing knowledge gaps about lung cancer screening guidelines, and educating physicians about how to have these life-saving conversations with patients.\n Methods:\n A retrospective analysis was performed from the quarterly CHRISTUS Good Shepherd Internal Medicine Resident Clinic lung cancer screening metrics using our EPIC electronic medical records from September 2022 to February 2024. The lung cancer screening metric reflects the calculated the percentage of patients age 50-77 who are on the smoking risk history registry who have had a lung cancer screening exam within the last year. Our intervention consisted of multiple sessions of in person and virtual lectures, educating residents about how to calculate and document smoking pack years, counsel patients on the importance of lung cancer screening, and order lung cancer screening using the EPIC order set.\n Results:\n Prior to any interventions, CHRISTUS Good Shepherd Internal Medicine Resident Clinic lung cancer screening metric was at 42% during the 3rd quarter of 2022. In-class lectures started during the 4th quarter of 2022. At the 4th quarter of 2022 and the 1st quarter of 2023, lung cancer screening rates increased to 44% and 52%, respectively. It was noticed that the metric plateau was about 48% over the next two quarters resulting in an overall increase of 5% from the pre-intervention phase.\n Conclusions:\n Our project showed that educating residents on the lung cancer screening guidelines and its application in clinical practice led to an increased rate of lung cancer screenings. The plateau in our study highlights the need for ongoing medical education and additional interventions to achieve substantial improvements in screening rates. Perhaps, targeting education toward patients about the importance, affordability, and safety of lung cancer screening could complement resident education and create a synergistic effect. We aim to further investigate how patient-centered interventions, like providing educational flyers in clinics and public places, can influence lung cancer screening rates.\n",

Findings revealed significant increases in self-ratings of interoceptive awareness concerning the utility of bodily sensations, as well as interconnectedness of mental, emotional, and physiological processes for self-regulation. VR biofeedback may have conferred an added potential benefit through increases in attention regulation scores. While the effects of VR and FS biofeedback did not differ, the order of modality exposure influenced specific interoceptive outcomes. These findings demonstrate the potential of biofeedback games in enhancing interoceptive awareness, with clinical implications for improving emotion regulation and mental health.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To assess the heart attack (HA) knowledge, awareness, and attitude among adults in Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia, and to identify gaps in understanding that could hinder prompt medical intervention. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire distributed via Google Forms from January to March 2024. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS, Version 29, to evaluate associations between demographics and HA awareness. Results: Participants demonstrated moderate awareness of non-classical HA symptoms such as slurred speech (relative importance index (RII) = 72.88%) and dizziness (66.35%), whereas critical symptoms such as chest pain (47.8%) and shortness of breath (47.25%) were among the least recognized. This suggests a concerning gap in knowledge of the most urgent indicators of HA. Respondents showed higher awareness of non-modifiable risk factors such as family history (RII = 70.99%) and high cholesterol (63.92%) compared to modifiable lifestyle-related risks. Smoking (43.71%) and obesity (43.08%) ranked lowest in awareness, indicating insufficient recognition of preventable contributors to cardiovascular disease. Participants exhibited a high level of hesitation in seeking immediate medical attention during a suspected HA. Social embarrassment (RII = 67.36%) and concerns about healthcare costs (66.08%) were the primary reasons cited for delay. Alarmingly, the belief that one should wait to be \u2018very sure\u2019 before going to the hospital was common (RII = 59.01%), whereas the urgency of symptoms such as persistent chest pain was undervalued (RII = 31.18%). Significant differences in symptom recognition were observed across age groups (e.g., P = 0.001 for jaw/neck/back pain), education levels (e.g., P = 0.028 for pain in arms/shoulders), and marital status (e.g., P = 0.002 for several symptoms). No significant gender-based differences were found. Conclusion: Al-Hasa population showed good knowledge and awareness of HA symptoms and risk factors; however, significant gaps exist in recognizing less common symptoms and emergency procedures. Poor attitude was shown toward HA seeking medical care. Concerns about cost, embarrassment, and suspicion in the severity of the symptoms appeared to be barriers to seeking timely care.",

      "abstract": "In rare circumstances, hypercapnia can precipitate life-threatening cardiac events, particularly in patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Awareness during such episodes of unresponsiveness is uncommon, underscoring the complex interaction between respiratory and neurologic physiology. A 58-year-old Caucasian female with a body mass index of 37.4 kg/m\u00b2, OSA, and a history of recurrent syncope presented to the emergency room with chest pain and shortness of breath. During hospitalization, she received sublingual nitroglycerin, after which she developed bradycardia and was administered atropine. She subsequently progressed into ventricular tachycardia and required two defibrillations to restore sinus rhythm. Remarkably, during resuscitation, she reported awareness despite unresponsiveness, hearing staff, and feeling defibrillation shocks. A comprehensive cardiac evaluation, including catheterization, troponin trends, ECG, imaging, echocardiography, Doppler studies, cultures, and laboratory tests, revealed no acute coronary pathology. She was admitted to the intensive care unit, underwent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, and was later discharged. Several days after discharge, she experienced another syncopal episode at home, this time with complete unresponsiveness and no awareness. On readmission, arterial blood gas analysis revealed significant hypercapnia, prompting initiation of bilevel positive airway pressure therapy. She improved clinically and was discharged on continuous positive airway pressure therapy for OSA, along with weight management counseling. This case emphasizes the importance of recognizing hypercapnia-induced cardiac events in obese patients with severe OSA. Identifying this mechanism, particularly when presenting as unresponsiveness with preserved awareness, highlights the diagnostic challenges and the necessity for vigilant monitoring, non-invasive ventilation, ICD support, and lifestyle modification to prevent recurrence and improve long-term outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Our thoughts are inherently dynamic and often wander far from our current situation (mind wandering, MW). Although previous research revealed that brain regions involved in arousal regulation modulate neural dynamics to facilitate the transition from MW to the awareness of its occurrence, the specific physiological states and afferent signals underlying this process remain unclear. In this study, we examined electroencephalography, electrocardiography, and respiration data before participants were aware of MW during a task in which they focused on external or internal stimuli (tones or their breath). We showed that the transition to awareness of MW was characterized by decreased alpha and beta activity and a suppression of the parietal later component of the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP), a modulation pattern identified in this study as a marker of enhanced central processing based on its consistent appearance across internal attention conditions. Furthermore, when participants were instructed to focus on their breath, they were more likely to be in the exhalation phase during the transition to awareness of MW and in the inhalation phase when MW was reported. This respiratory pattern was accompanied by changes in cardiac activity and HEP amplitudes. Based on these findings, we propose that the transition from MW to the awareness of its occurrence is associated with diverse neural activity, including the enhanced processing of bodily signals that co-occurs with specific cardiac and respiratory dynamics.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains a leading cause of severe illness in infancy, and the recent availability of new monoclonal antibodies such as nirsevimab presents an appealing prevention choice. Thus, this study investigated parental awareness, attitude, and acceptability to the application of monoclonal antibody treatment for prevention of RSV among parents in Jordan. In April\u2013June 2025, 597 parents of children aged below 5-years old were surveyed via an online survey. Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 22, logistic regression being employed to examine predictors of acceptance by parents of monoclonal antibody treatment. Over half (330; 55.3%) were aware of RSV, the majority of whom were aware of the most obvious symptoms such as cough (301; 91.2%) and shortness of breath (298; 90.3%). Social media was the best source of information (82.1%). Awareness of monoclonal antibodies was minimal (144; 43.6%), but over half of those who were aware (91; 63.2%) were willing to have their child treated. Altogether, 381 parents (63.9%) believed monoclonal antibodies were effective, and 419 (70.2%) used pediatricians as their primary source of information. The study indicated that female parents, and those who reported believing in monoclonal antibodies effectiveness were more likely to report willingness to use treatment (AOR\u2009=\u20095.161, p\u2009<\u2009.001). Despite low awareness in general about RSV, parents have positive feelings toward monoclonal antibody injections, and professional, clear communications are critical with particular reference to mothers to increase acceptability and utilization of RSV prevention strategies in Jordan.",

      "abstract": "Background: Su\u0304ryanamaska\u0304r (Sun Salutation) is a dynamic sequence of yoga postures that integrates movement, breath,\u00a0 and awareness. It is widely practiced for its physical, mental, and spiritual benefits. Variations in speed and intensity\u00a0 can influence its physiological and psychological effects. Anxiety and fatigue are prevalent concerns among college\u00a0 students due to academic pressure and lifestyle factors while Yoga has been recognized as an effective intervention for\u00a0 stress reduction, the comparative impact of slow and fast Su\u0304ryanamaska\u0304r on anxiety and fatigue remains underexplored.\u00a0Aim: This study aims to compare the effects of slow Su\u0304ryanamaska\u0304r with awareness and proper breathing versus fast\u00a0 Su\u0304ryanamaska\u0304r on anxiety and fatigue levels in college students.\u00a0Materials and Methods: The study followed an interventional pre-test and post-test design, involving 80 students\u00a0 from Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee College of Physical Education, Nurpur, Kangra, Himachal Pradesh. Participants\u00a0 were randomly assigned to two interventional groups: Group A (Fast Su\u0304ryanamaska\u0304r) \u2013 40 students and Group B (Slow\u00a0 Su\u0304ryanamaska\u0304r) \u2013 40 students. Anxiety levels were assessed using the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and fatigue levels were\u00a0 measured through the Fatigue Severity Scale. Both assessments were conducted before and after the intervention.\u00a0Intervention: Participants engaged in an 8-week structured yoga program, practicing 6 days a week under the\u00a0 supervision of a certified Yoga instructor. Group A (fast Su\u0304ryanamaska\u0304r) performed 36 rounds at a pace of 30 s/ round, emphasizing speed and rhythm rather than awareness. Group B (Slow Su\u0304ryanamaska\u0304r) performed 36 rounds\u00a0 at a pace of 1 round/min, focusing on breath awareness and mindfulness. Each session included 10 min of Sukshma\u00a0 Vyayama (preparatory exercises) and 4 minutes of Shavasana (relaxation) post-practice.\u00a0Results: The statistical analysis using paired and independent t-tests showed that: Group A exhibited a minor reduction\u00a0 in anxiety (pre-test mean = 26.99, post-test mean = 25.79; t = 1.0709), but it was not statistically significant. Group B\u00a0 showed a significant reduction in anxiety (pre-test mean = 26.75, post-test mean = 21.32; t = 3.3837, P < 0.05). Asimilar\u00a0 pattern was observed for fatigue levels, with GroupB demonstrating a highly significant reduction compared to GroupA.\u00a0Conclusion: The study highlights that slow-paced Su\u0304ryanamaska\u0304r is significantly more effective in reducing\u00a0 anxiety and fatigue compared to its fast-paced counterpart. The intensity and physiological engagement of slow\u00a0 Su\u0304ryanamaska\u0304r likely contribute to its superior benefits. Future research should investigate the neurophysiological\u00a0 mechanisms and long-term impacts of these variations on mental health.\u00a0",

      "abstract": "This review study explores the significance of body awareness in flute playing, emphasizing its role in integrating technical proficiency, breath control, posture, and expressive performance. Framed within contemporary instrumental pedagogy, the paper underscores that musical performance is not limited to motor skills but involves the interplay of cognitive, emotional, and physical processes. Body awareness encompassing the conscious perception and regulation of posture, muscle tension, breathing rhythm, and movement through mechanisms such as interoception, proprioception, and kinesthetic awareness is identified as a key factor in enhancing technical accuracy, sound quality, and overall artistic expression. The study reviews relevant literature and proposes pedagogical strategies for developing body awareness, including somatic education methods such as the Alexander Technique, Feldenkrais Method, and Body Mapping. In addition to synthesizing existing research, the paper offers practical suggestions and incorporates assessment forms designed to support both educators and students in monitoring progress. By highlighting the centrality of awareness in preventing performance-related injuries and fostering sustainable musicianship, the study advocates for the integration of structured body awareness training into flute education curricula to promote both artistic excellence and physical well-being.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The study aims to evaluate the effects of virtual reality (VR) programs on disease activity, central sensitization, kinesiophobia, body awareness, and pain catastrophizing in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Twenty-nine with FMS were randomized into the VR group or the control group (CG). FMS patients in the VR group were included in the VR-based relaxing treatment for 4\u2009weeks, with one session per week. The progressive muscle relaxation technique and the breath-counting exercise were taught to participants in the CG. The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Central Sensitization Inventory Short-Form (CSI-SF), TAMPA, Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), and Body Awareness Questionnaire (BAQ) were evaluated. Additionally, in the VR group, the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ), pain, stress, and exhaustion were assessed during each session. Post-treatment, the VR group showed significantly greater improvements than the CG in FIQ, CSI-SF, PCS, and BAQ (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Effect sizes in the VR group, except for TAMPA, ranged from large to very large (Cohen\u2019s d\u2009=\u20090.993\u20131.350). Although GSR scores decreased post-treatment, this reduction was not statistically significant (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Additionally, symptoms of SSQ, pain, stress, and exhaustion were notably reduced in the VR group. we recommend the widespread use of this innovative treatment approach in FMS patients.",

      "abstract": "For most patients with chronic, progressive illnesses, maintaining good quality of life (QoL), with preserved functional capacity, is just as crucial as prolonging survival. Patients with heart failure (HF) experience much worse QoL and effort intolerance than both the general population and people with other chronic conditions, since they present a range of physical and psychological symptoms, including shortness of breath, chest discomfort, fatigue, fluid congestion, trouble with sleeping, and depression. These symptoms reduce patients' capacity for daily social and physical activity. Usual endpoints of large-scale trials in chronic HF have mostly been defined to evaluate treatments regarding hospitalizations and mortality, but more recently, patients' priorities and needs expressed with QoL are gaining more awareness and are being more extensively evaluated. This scientific statement aims at discussing the importance of QoL in HF, summarizing the most largely adopted questionnaires in HF care, and providing an overview on their application in trials and the potential for their transition to clinical practice. Finally, by discussing the reasons limiting their application in daily clinical routine and the strategies that may promote their implementation, this statement aims at fostering the systematic integration of the patient's standpoint in HF care.",

      "abstract": "For most patients with chronic, progressive illnesses, maintaining good quality of life (QoL), with preserved functional capacity, is just as crucial as prolonging survival. Patients with heart failure (HF) experience much worse QoL and effort intolerance than both the general population and people with other chronic conditions, since they present a range of physical and psychological symptoms, including shortness of breath, chest discomfort, fatigue, fluid congestion, trouble with sleeping, and depression. These symptoms reduce patients' capacity for daily social and physical activity. Usual endpoints of large\u2010scale trials in chronic HF have mostly been defined to evaluate treatments regarding hospitalizations and mortality, but more recently, patients' priorities and needs expressed with QoL are gaining more awareness and are being more extensively evaluated. This scientific statement aims at discussing the importance of QoL in HF, summarizing the most largely adopted questionnaires in HF care, and providing an overview on their application in trials and the potential for their transition to clinical practice. Finally, by discussing the reasons limiting their application in daily clinical routine and the strategies that may promote their implementation, this statement aims at fostering the systematic integration of the patient's standpoint in HF care.",

      "abstract": "Early life adversity (ELA) disrupts default mode network (DMN) integrity subserving self-referential processes involved in emotional awareness and regulation. Mindfulness training (MT) reduces self-referential processing and down-regulates the DMN. We employed neurofeedback-augmented mindfulness training (NAMT), combining a core mindfulness strategy (focusing on breath) with real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) to modulate DMN by targeting the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). ELA-exposed (ELA; n\u2009=\u200943) and healthy control (HC; n\u2009=\u200940) adolescents completed a scan with three conditions: (a) Focus-on-breath (MT): rtfMRI-nf was presented as a variable-height bar, and adolescents attempted to lower the bar; (b) Describe: engaging self-referential processing; and (c) Rest. ELA were single-blind randomized to active PCC rtfMR-nf (NF; n\u2009=\u200922) or artificial feedback (SHAM; n\u2009=\u200921). Adolescents reported perceived stress, state mindfulness, and affect at baseline, post-training, and one-week follow-up. General linear models (GLMs) examined group differences (ELA vs. HC; NF vs. SHAM) on neural (MT vs. Describe) and self-report measures. ELA showed greater difficulty in PCC down-regulation relative to HC. For ELA, SHAM evidenced similar PCC down-regulation as active NF. All adolescents reported increased state mindfulness post-training. Relative to HC, ELA reported greater improvements in positive affect, negative affect and stress at follow-up. There was no difference in self-reported measures between active and SHAM. PCC responses in ELA confirm the region\u2019s utility as a potential treatment target. NAMT was feasible and acceptable for ELA-exposed adolescents, but may not enhance mindfulness training more than SHAM. Optimal strategies for enhancing PCC regulation in ELA may be elucidated with future research.",

      "abstract": "Lucid dreaming relies on a high level of metacognition and requires significant time and effort to master induction techniques, presenting obstacles for those seeking such experiences. This study proposes a personalized lucid dreaming training system Noetic Dream that combines virtual reality (VR) with open-monitoring(OM) meditation, acting on the mechanism of \"dream awareness\" through both external and internal pathways. VR provides immersive dream-based games to help users practice identifying unrealistic states, while OM meditation stabilizes internal focus and implants lucid intent. The training cycle uses multimodal cues to help users establish dream recognition mechanisms, thereby increasing the likelihood of lucid dreaming. The contributions of this study include: applying generative language models (LLMs) to construct dream VR scenarios, designing dream anomaly detection game mechanisms to stimulate dream awareness, and integrating OM meditation to achieve a non-invasive lucid dreaming training pathway, thereby effectively increasing the probability of spontaneous lucid dreaming.",

      "abstract": "Despite the presence of mystical-type experiences in psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT), an understanding of the cognitive processes involved is still lacking. Guided by theory and empirical research, we hypothesized a cognitive-grounded perspective based on current metacognition models to promote the understanding of the psychological processes involved in mystical-type experiences induced by psychedelic substances. The definition of metacognition is reviewed, with a particular focus on its role in psychotherapy and how it is used to understand altered states of consciousness such as meditation, lucid dreaming, and ecstatic epilepsy. We theoretically posited that metacognition is affected by psychedelic substance intake. We used metacognition models to understand the noetic facet of the mystical-type experience potentially induced by psychedelics, focusing on insight processes and proposing a specific definition of the \u201cAha!\u201d/ \u201cEureka!\u201d experience as a metacognitive feeling of epistemic gain. We hypothesized that the noetic feature of the psychedelic-induced mystical-type experience might account for the activation of procedural, performance-based, outcome-related metacognitive feelings, which are metacognitive feelings of epistemic gain. We review the potential implications of this framework within PAT in relation to clinically relevant aspects such as therapeutic preparation, intention setting, and outcome and integration; the use of music; traumatic memory recall; therapists\u2019 self-experience; suggestibility; and spiritual bypassing. Ultimately, we describe different lines of further research.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models have demonstrated expert-level accuracy on medical board examinations, suggesting potential for clinical decision support systems. However, their metacognitive abilities, crucial for medical decision-making, remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we developed MetaMedQA, a benchmark incorporating confidence scores and metacognitive tasks into multiple-choice medical questions. We evaluated twelve models on dimensions including confidence-based accuracy, missing answer recall, and unknown recall. Despite high accuracy on multiple-choice questions, our study revealed significant metacognitive deficiencies across all tested models. Models consistently failed to recognize their knowledge limitations and provided confident answers even when correct options were absent. In this work, we show that current models exhibit a critical disconnect between perceived and actual capabilities in medical reasoning, posing significant risks in clinical settings. Our findings emphasize the need for more robust evaluation frameworks that incorporate metacognitive abilities, essential for developing reliable Large Language Model enhanced clinical decision support systems. Large Language Models demonstrate expert-level accuracy in medical exams, supporting their potential inclusion in healthcare settings. Here, authors reveal that their metacognitive abilities are underexplored, showing significant gaps in recognizing knowledge limitations, difficulties in modulating their confidence, and challenges in identifying when a problem cannot be answered due to insufficient information.",

      "abstract": "One of the most important aspects of research on metacognition is the measurement of metacognitive ability. However, the properties of existing measures of metacognition have been mostly assumed rather than empirically established. Here I perform a comprehensive empirical assessment of 17 measures of metacognition. First, I develop a method of determining the validity and precision of a measure of metacognition and find that all 17 measures are valid and most show similar levels of precision. Second, I examine how measures of metacognition depend on task performance, response bias, and metacognitive bias, finding only weak dependences on response and metacognitive bias but many strong dependencies on task performance. Third, I find that all measures have very high split-half reliabilities, but most have poor test-retest reliabilities. This comprehensive assessment paints a complex picture: no measure of metacognition is perfect and different measures may be preferable in different experimental contexts. Measuring metacognitive ability is one of the enduring challenges in cognitive science. The current paper develops formal tests of the quality of different measures and assesses how current metrics perform on these tests.",

      "abstract": "This work presents Pangu Embedded, an efficient Large Language Model (LLM) reasoner developed on Ascend Neural Processing Units (NPUs), featuring flexible fast and slow thinking capabilities. Pangu Embedded addresses the significant computational costs and inference latency challenges prevalent in existing reasoning-optimized LLMs. We propose a two-stage training framework for its construction. In Stage 1, the model is finetuned via an iterative distillation process, incorporating inter-iteration model merging to effectively aggregate complementary knowledge. This is followed by reinforcement learning on Ascend clusters, optimized by a latency-tolerant scheduler that combines stale synchronous parallelism with prioritized data queues. The RL process is guided by a Multi-source Adaptive Reward System (MARS), which generates dynamic, task-specific reward signals using deterministic metrics and lightweight LLM evaluators for mathematics, coding, and general problem-solving tasks. Stage 2 introduces a dual-system framework, endowing Pangu Embedded with a\"fast\"mode for routine queries and a deeper\"slow\"mode for complex inference. This framework offers both manual mode switching for user control and an automatic, complexity-aware mode selection mechanism that dynamically allocates computational resources to balance latency and reasoning depth. Experimental results on benchmarks including AIME 2024, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench demonstrate that Pangu Embedded with 7B parameters, outperforms similar-size models like Qwen3-8B and GLM4-9B. It delivers rapid responses and state-of-the-art reasoning quality within a single, unified model architecture, highlighting a promising direction for developing powerful yet practically deployable LLM reasoners.",

      "abstract": "The integration of generative artificial intelligence tools in education has emerged as a transformative approach to enhancing learning outcomes, particularly in the context of sustainable development goals (SDG4). Therefore, the present study investigates the connection between generative artificial intelligence tool usage (GenAITU) and academic achievement (AA) in the context of SDG4. We assessed the mediating role of shared metacognition (SMC) and cognitive offloading (COL) in this relationship among preservice teachers (PSTs). The indicators, including performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), facilitating conditions (FC), and use behavior (UB), are derived from adapting the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) for GenAITU. The authors surveyed 465 students from five universities in Wuhan, China, using a 7-point Likert scale through a time-lag design. Statistical analysis was performed through partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), to determine the relationship between variables. Findings indicated that two components of GenAITU, namely PE and UB, showed significant positive associations with AA, while the other two, EE and FC, did not show significant and positive relationships with AA. Results also showed that three dimensions of GenAITU, namely EE, FC, and UB have a positive and significant association with SMC while PE has a positive and significant connection with SMC. All four components of GenAITU like PE, EE, FC, and UB have positive and significant links with COL. SMC and COL have a positive and significant relationship with AA. Results also indicated that SMC mediated the connections between GenAITU (EE, FC, and UB) and AA. Outcomes also indicated that COL mediated the connections between GenAITU (PE, EE, FC, and UB) and AA. The current study shows that SMC and COL were strong mediators of the association between GenAITU and AA. The results of our study provide guidance to teachers, curriculum planners, and university management to successfully integrate GenAITU into the education for PSTs.",

This special section collects emerging empirical evidence from diverse educational settings to examine how interactions with advanced GenAI systems\u2014ranging from intelligent tutors and conversational agents to AI\u2010generated feedback providers\u2014shape learners' cognitive engagement, epistemic agency, metacognitive regulation and emotional relationships with technology. While studies reveal evidence of positive effects in personalised guidance, collaborative inquiry and enhanced self\u2010reflection, findings also highlight risks such as diminished epistemic vigilance, superficial learning and emotional dependence on AI interlocutors. These insights advocate for an educational re\u2010imagining that actively experiments with novel AI technologies while continuously gathering and critically evaluating evidence\u2014envisioning education not merely as a spectrum ranging from fully human\u2010 or AI\u2010led activities but also as genuinely collaborative endeavours that balance human intelligence and AI capabilities in meaningful and ethically grounded partnerships. Looking ahead, in this editorial, we propose an interdisciplinary research roadmap that urges deeper examination of the cognitive and neural consequences associated with sustained AI exposure, together with the development of comprehensive frameworks to cultivate AI literacy and evaluative judgement. It also encourages rigorous assessment of the long\u2010term ethical implications of increasingly blurred human\u2010AI boundaries. Ultimately, advancing education in GenAI\u2010infused contexts requires proactive engagement with these emerging complexities, so that teachers and learners not only survive in an AI\u2010infused future but also creatively, critically and ethically co\u2010author it.",

As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in both high-stakes and widespread low-stakes contexts, it is important to assess whether, how, and to what extent they exhibit metacognitive abilities. Here, we provide an overview of the current knowledge of LLMs\u2019 metacognitive capacities, how they might be studied, and how they relate to our knowledge of metacognition in humans. We show that although humans and LLMs can sometimes appear quite aligned in their metacognitive capacities and behaviors, it is clear many differences remain; attending to these differences is important for enhancing the collaboration between humans and artificial intelligence. Last, we discuss how endowing future LLMs with more sensitive and more calibrated metacognition may also help them develop new capacities such as more efficient learning, self-direction, and curiosity.",

      "abstract": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has transformed various sectors, significantly enhancing processes and augmenting human capabilities. However, these advancements have also introduced critical concerns related to the safety, ethics, and responsibility of AI systems. To address these challenges, the principles of the robustness, interpretability, controllability, and ethical alignment framework are essential. This paper explores the integration of metacognition\u2014defined as \u201cthinking about thinking\u201d\u2014into AI systems as a promising approach to meeting these requirements. Metacognition enables AI systems to monitor, control, and regulate the system\u2019s cognitive processes, thereby enhancing their ability to self-assess, correct errors, and adapt to changing environments. By embedding metacognitive processes within AI, this paper proposes a framework that enhances the transparency, accountability, and adaptability of AI systems, fostering trust and mitigating risks associated with autonomous decision-making. Additionally, the paper examines the current state of AI safety and responsibility, discusses the applicability of metacognition to AI, and outlines a mathematical framework for incorporating metacognitive strategies into active learning processes. The findings aim to contribute to the development of safe, responsible, and ethically aligned AI systems.",

However, there has been limited research on quantitatively measuring metacognition within LLMs. Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology theories, we first quantify the metacognitive ability of LLMs as their ability to evaluate the correctness of responses through confidence. Subsequently, we introduce a general framework called DMC designed to decouple metacognitive ability and cognitive ability. This framework tackles the challenge of noisy quantification caused by the coupling of metacognition and cognition in current research, such as calibration-based metrics. Specifically, the DMC framework comprises two key steps. Initially, the framework tasks the LLM with failure prediction, aiming to evaluate the model's performance in predicting failures, a performance jointly determined by both cognitive and metacognitive abilities of the LLM. Following this, the framework disentangles metacognitive ability and cognitive ability based on the failure prediction performance, providing a quantification of the LLM's metacognitive ability independent of cognitive influences. Experiments conducted on eight datasets across five domains reveal that (1) Our proposed DMC framework effectively separates the metacognition and cognition of LLMs; (2) Various confidence elicitation methods impact the quantification of metacognitve ability differently; (3) Stronger metacognitive ability are exhibited by LLMs with better overall performance; (4) Enhancing metacognition holds promise for alleviating hallucination issues.",

The study sample consists of 155 university students from a higher education institution in Spain, who completed the PENCRISAL, the metacognitive abilities inventory, the Ryff psychological well-being scale, and the empathy quotient, which assess these psychological constructs. The results indicate that critical thinking has a direct positive effect on metacognition, which, in turn, is significantly associated with higher levels of psychological well-being and empathy. These findings reinforce the essential role of critical thinking in fostering cognitive self-regulation and socioemotional competencies.

Utilizing a purposive sampling method, 592 teachers from diverse educational settings participated in the study. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed to analyze the data, revealing that both self-efficacy and grit significantly predict work engagement, with teaching metacognition serving as a mediator in these relationships. Notably, the impact of self-efficacy on work engagement was stronger in Hong Kong, while grit exhibited a more pronounced indirect effect through metacognition in the same region. These findings underscore the importance of fostering self-efficacy and grit, alongside enhancing metacognitive practices, to bolster teacher engagement. The study highlights cultural and systemic factors that influence these dynamics, providing insights for developing targeted professional development programs and supportive educational policies tailored to different cultural contexts.",

This study aimed to explore how (person-level) creative self-efficacy and the perceived value of creativity inform (task-specific) judgments. A sample of 360 university students (176 women, Mage = 22.1 years) completed scales measuring creative self-efficacy and perceived value of creativity, and reported their metacognitive experiences (perceived difficulty), task interest and metacognitive judgments in two verbal creativity tasks. The results from structural equation modeling showed that creative self-efficacy predicted the initial task expectancy and metacognitive judgments, while the perceived value of creativity primarily informed judgments and expectancies indirectly through task interest. Furthermore, task performance weakly predicted metacognitive judgments, with perceived difficulty and interest serving as additional cues. These findings underscore the importance of both stable person-level variables and dynamic task-specific experiences in creative self-regulation. The study suggests that environments fostering creative self-efficacy and values may sustain long-term engagement in creative tasks, with implications for educational and workplace settings.",

      "abstract": "Individuals experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression have been shown to exhibit persistent underconfidence. The origin of such metacognitive biases presents a puzzle, given that individuals should be able to learn appropriate levels of confidence from observing their own performance. In two large general population samples (N\u2009=\u2009230 and N\u2009=\u2009278), we measure both 'local' confidence in individual task instances and 'global' confidence as longer-run self-performance estimates while manipulating external feedback. Global confidence is sensitive to both local confidence and feedback valence\u2014more frequent positive (negative) feedback increases (respectively decreases) global confidence, with asymmetries in feedback also leading to shifts in affective self-beliefs. Notably, however, global confidence exhibits reduced sensitivity to instances of higher local confidence in individuals with greater subclinical anxious-depression symptomatology, despite sensitivity to feedback valence remaining intact. Our finding of blunted sensitivity to increases in local confidence offers a mechanistic basis for how persistent underconfidence is maintained in the face of intact performance. Individuals with symptoms of anxiety and depression exhibit persistent underconfidence. Here, the authors show that distortions in learning from local metacognition can explain how underconfidence is maintained in the face of intact performance.",

      "abstract": "With the emergence of AI technology, its adoption in higher education has become an interesting field for researchers. The present study explores the acceptance of AI for learning the English language by Pakistani EFL students using the UTAUT-2 and Metacognition theory. The UTAUT-2 questionnaire was adapted with minor changes to make it suitable for the EFL context. Data were collected from the English departments of the top ten general universities in Pakistan to make the findings generalizable. Another step taken to ensure generalizability was the sampling of 611 students randomly from both undergraduate (BS and ADP) and postgraduate (MPhil and PhD) programs studying in different semesters. PLS-SEM was employed for data analysis. In the first step, the PLS algorithm was run for the measurement model, which confirmed the reliability, validity, and fitness of the model. Second, the bootstrapping method was used for hypothesis testing. The findings reveal that six of the ten hypotheses for direct relationships are supported. Habit (0.489) was found to be the strongest contributor to BI, followed by PE (0.141), SI (0.100), and FC (0.093). Moreover, actual use behaviour was predicted by habit (0.325) instead of BI and FC. These findings are supported by metacognition theory, as the habit of AI seems to shape the metacognitive knowledge of EFL learners in place of traditional learning methods, and other factors seem to reinforce the metacognitive experience of using AI language. The study suggests implications for EFL experts, academia, and policymakers to strategically integrate AI into language learning by informing them of its potential benefits and risks.",

      "abstract": "\n Collaborative learning is a fundamental skill based on the construction of knowledge through collaborative discussion in order to comprehend diverse perspectives. In online and flipped classrooms, which have become popular in higher education, learning interventions that provide a high level of collaborative cognitive support are required to increase active participation and enhance learning. At this point, there is a need to explain the contribution of socially shared metacognition (SSM) support for effective collaborative work in online and flipped classrooms. This study aims to investigate the effect of online and flipped classes supported by SSM on group metacognition (MCO), group belonging (GB), cohesion, and motivation. For this purpose, an experimental intervention consisting of two sub-studies was conducted with 330 university students. Descriptive statistics and partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) analyses were employed in the analysis of the data. As a result of the research, when the pretest and posttest results were compared in the group provided with flipped SSM support, it was found that group belonging, metacognition, cohesion, and intrinsic and extrinsic motivation scores showed significant and positive development. In the online SSM-supported group, group cohesion (GC) showed a significant increase in the context of the pretest and posttest scores. In MGA analysis, it was concluded that the path coefficient differentiation of group metacognition was higher in those who received online SSM support. SSM support positively affected the perception of task difficulty in both flipped and online classes.",

      "abstract": "Metacognition, which involves the deliberate awareness and analysis of one\u2019s own learning and thought processes, has gained significant traction among educational researchers. The burgeoning volume of metacognition studies underscores the importance of examining its current status and evolving trends. Leveraging topic modeling and bibliometrics on a dataset comprising 2568 papers spanning from 2000 to 2023, this study seeks to address questions like \u201cWhat are the prevailing research themes in metacognition?\u201d and \u201cHow has the level of research attention to these themes evolved over time?\u201d This study also scrutinizes major journals, countries/regions, academic institutions, and collaborative networks, presenting a visual representation of their interconnections. Considering the analyses conducted, this study proffers several recommendations for the future of metacognition research. Firstly, it suggests the integration of metacognitive instruction, assessment, and feedback mechanisms into various educational domains, encompassing design, healthcare, language, teacher training, as well as special and early childhood education. Secondly, it advocates for the exploration and utilization of diverse metacognitive instructional strategies and analytics technologies to effectively bolster students\u2019 metacognitive processes. Lastly, it underscores the significance of interdisciplinary collaborations between metacognition experts, educators, psychologists, computer scientists, and data scientists. Such collaborative efforts are envisioned to harness the potentials of big data and learning analytics technologies to inform pedagogical practices that nurture metacognitive skills. This study offers a comprehensive overview of metacognition research in the realm of education, shedding light on emerging trends in metacognitive instructional practices and providing valuable insights for charting the course of future investigations in this field.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The findings derived from quantitative research indicate that mindfulness possesses a valuable potential for fostering the health and well-being of employees, as well as facilitating organizational change. However, despite the perceived objectivity and comprehensiveness often associated with quantitative studies, quantitative investigations are constrained by i) their ability to only portray predefined changes measured through questionnaires, and ii) their inability to elucidate the contextual factors that facilitate the sustained cultivation of mindfulness within an organization. OBJECTIVES: We undertook a qualitative study with the aim of uncovering novel facets concerning the prospective influence of mindfulness integration in the workplace, and identifying the determinants contributing to its long-term establishment. METHODS: We employed a qualitative research approach comprising sixteen expert interviews and a critical friend interview with mindfulness experts working in small to large organizations. Subsequently, we employed a data-driven qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The findings from the expert interviews revealed three key outcomes of mindfulness integration in the workplace: strengthening of individual competencies (e.g., presence), improved understanding of work meaningfulness and positive affect (e.g., joy), and fostering a more positive work atmosphere (e.g., gratitude). Additionally, the requirements for establishing mindfulness in the workplace can be classified into three categories: organizational structure (e.g., designated places), organizational culture (e.g., transparency), and mindfulness program structure (e.g., transferability). CONCLUSIONS: These findings help to generate new hypotheses about the efficacy of mindfulness at the workplace, can support scholars to advance this line of research and provide guidance for practitioners considering implementing mindfulness (interventions) for employees.",

METHODS: All students enrolled in a second-year veterinary anesthesiology course during 1 term were offered participation in the mindfulness program, with volunteers forming the intervention group and nonparticipants serving as a comparison group. Perceived stress, self-compassion, and depression were measured before and after the program using validated questionnaires, and academic performance was assessed via scores on the second midterm examination and final examination. The study followed an action research framework and employed a quasi-experimental design. RESULTS: After training, the intervention group demonstrated a substantial reduction in perceived stress and an increase in self-compassion, whereas the comparison group showed minimal change. Depression scores remained unchanged in both groups. On the second midterm, the mindfulness group's mean score exceeded that of controls by approximately 9 percentage points. By the final examination, all students had improved, and no significant score differences persisted. CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness training was associated with reduced perceived stress, enhanced self-compassion, and a transient improvement in midterm performance. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Mindfulness interventions may support veterinary students' well-being and academic success.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: While mindfulness has demonstrated efficacy in enhancing executive function in non-athletes through improved present-moment awareness and acceptance of current experiences, particularly regarding attention regulation and cognitive control, its neurocognitive mechanisms and the effects and underlying mechanisms of mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on different executive functioning skills in athletic populations remain poorly understood. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial tackles a novel and important topic by investigating the beneficial effects of 12-week MBI on executive functioning skills in baseball players-a population that faces unique cognitive and physical demands, and the associated neurophysiological and biochemical regulation mechanisms. METHODS: Thirty-four baseball players were randomly divided into the MBI group (11M/6F) and the control group (11M/6F). Executive functioning skills (N-back task for working memory, Stroop task for inhibitory control, and Switching task for cognitive flexibility) were tested before and after the intervention. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to record quantified hemodynamic responses in the prefrontal cortex through oxygenated hemoglobin concentration (Oxy-Hb) monitoring during the performance of executive function tasks. Biomarkers of cognitive function, including BDNF, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and cortisol, were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). RESULTS: MBI partially improved all three executive function skills, with increased Oxy-Hb level in L-FPA during the task of working memory, increased Oxy-Hb level in R-VLPFC during the task of inhibitory control, and decreased Oxy-Hb level in R-FPA, M-FPA, and L-DLPFC during the task of cognitive flexibility. Furthermore, MBI increased circulating BDNF level and decreased IL-6 and cortisol levels. In addition, our correlation analyses showed that improvement in executive function (improved behavioral performances and changes in Oxy-Hb levels) were associated with changes in cortisol and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6). CONCLUSION: A 12-week MBI partially improved three components of executive function in baseball players. This enhancement may be attributed to the MBI-induced reductions in cortisol and inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6), which altered blood oxygen contents in specific brain regions, thereby promoting executive function.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: There is a great need for the development of scalable augmentations to treatments for anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN), as most individuals with AN/BN are currently not able to access treatment. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) may be promising for AN/BN and lend themselves well to digital delivery, increasing access. We aimed to develop and test the initial acceptability and feasibility of Mindful Courage, a digital MBI for AN/BN and atypical AN/BN. METHOD: We evaluated an 8-week version of Mindful Courage including 32 modules (8 core multi-media lessons, 24 brief audio-guided mindfulness practices) in N\u2009=\u200932 participants, who also received weekly phone coaching conducted by psychology students. Ten participants (31.2%) were enrolled in outpatient ED treatment while receiving the intervention. Participants completed assessments at baseline, post-intervention (8\u2009weeks), and 2-month post-intervention follow-up. RESULTS: Acceptability was demonstrated by relatively high ratings for perceived usability (81.34/100), understandability (4.6/5.0), engageability (4.1/5.0), visual appeal (4.1/5.0), helpfulness (4.2/5.0), skills acquisition (4.3/5.0), and confidence applying skills (4.2/5.0). Feasibility was demonstrated by high module completion (an average of 28/32 modules). There were significant reductions in target outcomes: ED symptoms (d\u2009=\u20091.21), body dissatisfaction (d\u2009=\u20090.73), depression (d\u2009=\u20090.76), anxiety (d\u2009=\u20090.62), and clinical impairment (d\u2009=\u20091.15). In addition, there were significant improvements in target mechanisms: mindfulness (d\u2009=\u20090.79), emotion regulation difficulties (d\u2009=\u20090.65), and savoring beliefs (d\u2009=\u20090.58). DISCUSSION: Mindful Courage is a viable and potentially effective intervention. A future randomized-controlled trial is warranted.",

      "abstract": "Interoception has been reported to be associated with the experience of negative emotions. However, its contribution to positive emotion-particularly its role in savoring positive emotion-remains less well understood, and the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms are not fully characterized. Using electroencephalography (EEG), the present study examined whether priming interoceptive attention would influence the savoring of positive emotions and explored the associated neurophysiological patterns. Twenty-nine participants completed an interoceptive priming task (IPT). The results indicated that interoceptive attention was associated with enhanced subjective emotional experiences and a reduction in late positive potential amplitude at centro-parietal sites during the savoring of positive emotions. Additionally, increased alpha power in occipital regions was observed while viewing positive pictures, whereas elevated beta power in right-frontal regions emerged when savoring positive emotions. Together, these findings indicate that interoceptive attention strengthens subjective positive feelings and modulates neural activity during positive emotion savoring, providing deeper insight into how interoception facilitates savoring.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Ecstatic seizures (EcS) have captured scientific interest due to their potential origin in anterior insular networks, emphasizing the insula's role in self-processing. Their frequency in epilepsy or insular pathology has not been systematically studied. Present study aimed to examine the frequency and clinical characteristics of EcS in epilepsy patients, and the potential occurrence of ecstatic symptoms in insula tumor patients. METHOD: Preformatted questionnaires on symptom reporting were sent to 200 epilepsy patients and 40 with resected insular tumors. Patients reporting EcS-related symptoms underwent in-person interviews. Hospital records, including EEG and imaging, were analyzed. Seizure-related experiences with supernatural, religious, spiritual, mystical, or ecstatic features were referred to as \"numinous-like symptoms\" throughout the article. RESULTS: Interestingly, a variety of rare, numinous-like ictal experiences were found, all of which are discussed in this study. In the epilepsy cohort, 83 patients responded, five (6.0\u00a0%) reported symptoms that qualified them for interview and final analysis. In the tumor cohort, 23 patients responded, two (8.7\u00a0%) reported relevant symptoms, both with pre-existing epilepsy. During the interviews, we identified EcS (n\u00a0=\u00a01), ictal out-of-body experiences (OBE) (n\u00a0=\u00a02), and ictal sensed presence (SenP) (n\u00a0=\u00a05); one patient experienced both SenP and OBE. Three SenP patients had seizure origin in the right hemisphere: two had resected tumors in the temporo-insular region and one had mesial temporal sclerosis. The EcS patient had aphasia as an early seizure symptom and left-sided temporal interictal epileptiform activity. The remaining patients had less distinct investigational results. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that seizure-related numinous-like experiences are not uncommon and should be actively assessed, given the difficulty and reluctance of patients to speak about them, and their relevance for evaluating seizure freedom and differential diagnoses. Neuroscientifically, these phenomena offer insight into consciousness: EcS and OBE occupy distinct nodes in self-processing networks, whereas SenP requires further cognitive, psychological, and phenomenological analysis to guide future neurobiological research.",
