      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Although previous studies have explored factors influencing teachers' professional identity, limited attention has been given to its underlying psychological mechanisms from a metacognitive perspective. In particular, few studies have examined how mindfulness, a core psychological resource, relates to professional identity among early childhood education teachers, a group facing unique emotional and occupational challenges. This study aims to investigate the relationships among mindfulness, psychological resilience, well-being, and professional identity among early childhood education teachers. It focuses on how mindfulness, as a metacognitive psychological resource, is associated with professional identity directly and indirectly through psychological resilience and well-being. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 854 full-time kindergarten teachers (48 males and 806 females; M RESULTS: The results demonstrated that mindfulness was positively associated with professional identity (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.15, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Psychological resilience significantly mediated this relationship (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.52, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), accounting for 55.5% of the total indirect effect. Well-being also served as an independent mediator (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.21, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), accounting for 22.6% of the total effect. In addition, a sequential mediation pathway was identified, in which psychological resilience and well-being sequentially mediated the relationship between mindfulness and professional identity (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.03, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). CONCLUSION: The findings highlight mindfulness as a critical factor in strengthening professional identity among early childhood educators by enhancing both psychological resilience and well-being. These results contribute to professional identity theory by incorporating metacognitive and psychological constructs, and also provide practical implications: integrating mindfulness-based interventions (e.g., mindfulness meditation, stress-reduction programs) into teacher training can help educators enhance emotion regulation and resilience. Additionally, creating supportive and caring work environments may further promote teachers' well-being and sustainable professional development.",

      "abstract": "Unusual bodily experiences (UBEs) are illusory bodily perceptions that are not coherent with typical wakeful experiences, including flying or floating sensations, body distortions, and out-of-body experiences. This study examines UBEs in a controlled sleep laboratory using meditation and light stimulation to facilitate their occurrence. A total of N\u00a0=\u00a035 healthy participants underwent high-density EEG, with additional EMG, EOG, and ECG recordings. Participants signalled UBEs by performing left-right-left-right eye movements, providing an objective marker for analysis. Interviews adapted from the micro-phenomenological technique were conducted to capture detailed subjective reports and to guide subsequent sleep and EEG analyses. Of the 35 participants, N\u00a0=\u00a020 reported a total of n\u00a0=\u00a036 UBEs, occurring primarily during meditation (wakefulness) but also during sleep arousals, rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep. Spectral EEG analyses and generalized linear mixed models were used to investigate the neural correlates of these experiences, suggesting that UBEs emerge during intermediate states of consciousness combining EEG features of both wakefulness and sleep. Specifically, exploratory EEG analyses showed that UBEs across sleep and wakefulness were associated with EEG reactivation, marked by increased high-frequency activity (beta and gamma) and decreased low-frequency activity (delta and theta), with a particularly pronounced effect around temporal regions. Collectively, these results provide novel insights into the EEG correlates associated with UBEs and contribute to a deeper understanding of self-consciousness and body perception across sleep and wakefulness.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chiropractors commonly manage cervicogenic headache (CGH) and tension-type headache (TTH) using nonpharmacological interventions such as spinal manipulative therapy. However, dedicated guidelines on chiropractic management of headaches are outdated. METHODS: We first conducted an umbrella review. A search for systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines on nonpharmacological interventions for adults with CGH or TTH published from 2017 to August 2023 was conducted. At least two authors independently performed article screening, risk of bias/quality assessment, certainty of evidence, and data extraction. A steering committee developed statements from the synthesized data and seed documents, which were refined by anonymous feedback from a 57-member Delphi panel until reaching at least 80% consensus. The statements were then subjected to public comment, prompting further revisions that were subsequently reviewed by the Delphi panel. RESULTS: Thirty-two relevant articles were identified (31 systematic reviews and 1 clinical practice guideline). Statements included recommendations regarding history (e.g., red flags) and examination for CGH/TTH, recommendation to use of spinal manipulation for CGH, and for TTH only within multimodal care. Certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations for other nonpharmacological interventions (e.g., acupuncture and exercise) varied. Limitations in evidence precluded strong recommendations for acupuncture, education, meditation/mindfulness, and modalities used in isolation for CGH and electroacupuncture for TTH. CONCLUSIONS: This clinical practice guideline created evidence-based consensus recommendations for chiropractic management of adults with CGH and TTH. Chiropractors may appropriately care for individuals with CGH and TTH using a variety of nonpharmacological interventions, while considering best practices in diagnosis, referral, and other aspects of care management.",

      "abstract": "Amid increasing scholarly attention to faith-based organizational values, this study examines how Islamic workplace spirituality and grit influence teachers' career commitment within private Islamic schools in Indonesia. Grounded in the constructs of istiq\u0101mah (steadfastness), mur\u0101qabah (spiritual mindfulness), and taqarrub (closeness to God), the research introduces an integrative framework in which grit serves as a mediating psychological mechanism linking spiritual orientation to vocational dedication. Utilizing data from 429 teachers across elementary, middle, and high schools, this study employed a quantitative cross-sectional design and used a convenience sampling technique to recruit participants. The data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to evaluate both the measurement and structural models. Findings demonstrate that istiq\u0101mah and mur\u0101qabah significantly and directly predict career commitment, whereas taqarrub exerts an indirect effect through grit. Grit itself emerges as a critical psychological construct that amplifies the influence of spiritual dimensions on professional perseverance. By bridging theological and psychological perspectives, this research offers a nuanced understanding of career motivation in religious educational settings. The results provide actionable insights for school leaders and policymakers seeking to cultivate spiritually grounded strategies that foster long-term professional commitment among educators.",

      "abstract": "Auditory hallucinations, a core symptom of schizophrenia, affect 50-70% of patients and significantly impair their quality of life. Although multimodal treatments, including pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and neuromodulation, are commonly employed, their efficacy remains limited. This randomized controlled trial aimed to assess the effects of Mindfulness-Based Auditory Hallucination Management (MBAHM) on auditory hallucinations, anxiety, depression, and quality of life in patients with schizophrenia. Eighty patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to the MBAHM group (n\u00a0=\u00a040) or the control group (n\u00a0=\u00a040). The MBAHM group received a 2-h MBAHM intervention twice a week for eight weeks, while the control group received routine treatment and care. Auditory hallucinations, anxiety, depression, and quality of life were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. The results revealed that, compared to both the baseline and the control group, the MBAHM group showed significant reductions in auditory hallucinations, anxiety, and depression, along with improvements in quality of life (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Correlation analyses further indicated significant associations between reductions in auditory hallucination severity, anxiety, and depression, alongside improvements in quality of life. These findings provide preliminary evidence that MBAHM may be an effective complementary approach for managing auditory hallucinations and improving overall well-being in patients with schizophrenia.
